</head>
<body>
<p>This chapter is about:
1. Steps to take to create a sales team.
2. Rules for the recruitment of sales managers for work.
3. Creation of a training and adaptation program for new employees of the department
sales.
Perhaps your company did not have a sales department before. This function could
perform some individual specialist or it could be distributed
between employees of other departments. It even happens that sales
have to deal directly with the director or owner of the enterprise.
But time passes, and this time costs money. Delegate the sales function specifically
trained professionals prove to be much more profitable than
try to do it with the help of the most expensive people in the company (top
managers).
And you decided to create a sales department.
Congratulations! This decision is in itself the first step towards
serious growth of your business! However, how "not to break firewood", but to build
a truly effective business unit that will bring
enterprise customers, money, profit?
To do this, follow these steps:
1. Develop functional responsibilities for sellers.
In the previous chapter, we gave a brief description of the key functional
responsibilities of a sales manager, which should be adapted to
your business. You will have to consider what types of sales apply in your
company, and what distinctions and specializations of sellers will be required in your
case.
2. Approve the organizational structure of the future sales department.
It will be necessary to make a decision: who will lead this department - one
of the salespeople, a dedicated sales manager (DSC), or this
the function will be delegated to someone from a higher level at first
management (for example, directly to the director, or to the commercial
director).
• It will also be important to take into account the specifics of the first paragraph (functional
sales responsibilities) – and in the case of specialization of different employees
on various types of sales (direct/indirect, active/passive,
transactional / consulting, new / repeated) take this into account in
organizational structure.
• You will also need to take into account other features of sales in your company
(distribution between sellers of customers by product categories,
business size or geography).
• And, which is also important, to determine in advance the connections of the sales department with other
departments with which you will have to interact - accounting, department
marketing departments, logistics departments, engineering departments,
warehouses, and so on.
• It is necessary to agree on the distribution of responsibilities and authorities
between the head of the sales department (how and to whom he can give
instructions or in what order to make requests) and employees and
heads of other structural divisions of your enterprise.
3. Decide on a working interface for the seller.
• What programs will your salesperson use to work with clients?
• Which product will store information about the company's customer base,
available to the seller (without the ability to download it and leave to work for
competitors)?
• How the manager will record the history of his contacts and
relationships with customers?
Ten years ago, many companies employed product managers
sales of conventional office software packages (MS Office, as the most famous
example), a little later they began to do the same in cloud solutions (such as
Google Docs). This is acceptable, but significantly reduces the capacity of your department.
sales in modern conditions - a little later we will explain why.
Today, more and more businesses are starting to transfer 100 percent
their salespeople to work in CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems,
allowing to organize transparent (for the management) and effective (for the seller) interaction with all types of customers (potential and
existing, new and regular. large and small).
With CRM systems it is quite easy to integrate a large number of other
software products:
• telephony and e-mail,
• programs for invoicing and receiving payments from customers,
• group work with documents
• and much more, which we will talk about in a separate chapter on
CRM.
It is desirable that new employees of the sales department start work in a ready-made
modern interface, which managers will be visually
demonstrate the effectiveness (or inefficiency) of their work, and themselves
Sellers will be able to negotiate deals more often and more easily. AT
In the fourth chapter of this Sales Book, we will present to your attention the modern
and innovative Bitrix24.CRM, which your sales team can easily and
turn it on quickly and start selling more efficiently.
4. Write job postings for potential sales staff, and
identify job search channels (Internet job search portals,
recruiting agencies, labor exchange, etc.). Agree on interview rules
newcomers and responsible persons for recruitment and admission to the state - usually this role is performed by
ROP, together with the HR department.
5. Draw up the rules for passing the probationary period and the training program and
adaptation of new employees. This item is missing even in the vast majority
most companies that have been on the market for a long time, and in which departments
sales work not the first year. For some reason, it is believed that the seller either already
must be a formed "star", able to sell anything to anyone
anything - or it is such an easy specialty that anyone can master
wishing, there would be a wish. Beginners are "thrown into battle" from the very first working days,
do not pay enough attention to the period of their adaptation in the company, development
skills of working in a specialized market, with specific (sometimes -
unfamiliar) products or services, and then wonder why so few of them
they are undergoing a probationary period and show more or less good results
sales in the first year of operation.
6. Develop and approve a system of material and non-material incentives
sales department employees. The simplest thing a company owner can do
is to assign sellers either constant salaries, or it is enough
common remuneration system "rate plus percentage". The first
example is the most unfortunate, since it will not motivate managers in any way
in sales to achieve at least some results in the work. The second - as we already
said, the most common, but not optimal. Explain: if the seller
receives the same percentage upon achieving absolutely any result, then he
it will be absolutely unimportant whether the company achieves planned targets or not,
whether he concludes contracts at the maximum cost, or, conversely, for the sake of
transactions provides maximum discounts. More about motivation systems for
sales department, we will talk in the eighth chapter, which will be completely devoted to
exactly this question.
7. Approve a system of financial and legal discipline for sellers -
what documents need to be agreed before concluding a transaction, and with whom, what
how to accept payments from customers, how and by whom these payments will be confirmed
(so that you do not have to "take the word" of buyers), what to do if the buyer
remained indebted to the company (accounts receivable due to
installment payment options, for example), as well as what to do if
The customer is dissatisfied and wants a refund. This topic is also covered in a separate
the ninth chapter of the Sales Book.
If you have prepared all of the above points - congratulations to you twice, you
almost ready to start the work of the sales department! If your sales team is already
works for a while, but you decided to test yourself, re-read these
points, and weigh whether everything is working correctly in your business?
If you're not sure how to recruit someone for the sales team, you want to avoid
mistakes at this stage, and conduct a quality selection of candidates and effective
interviews, then read the recommended selection rules for candidates and
interviews that we have prepared for our readers:
Principles for recruiting new salespeople to the sales department
To select the most suitable candidates for the position of manager
(specialist) in sales, the manager is recommended to consider the following
factors:
1. When studying the summary: 1.1. Career history
It is necessary to analyze the professional experience of the candidate. If the candidate
moved from sales to process activities (financial
management, engineering, technical support, etc.), it is quite possible that
the seller's competencies are lame, or he is not sufficiently motivated to work in
sales, or perhaps process oriented, which is
unacceptable for a successful sales manager. Need to find out
reasons for such a dramatic change in his career at the interview and make
correct conclusions, or initially not to invite such candidates to
interviews.
1.2. Frequency of employer change
As a rule, a good "salesperson" is motivated by money and results, but, to
Unfortunately, the motivation system for the sales department is not always transparent,
understandable and fair. In conditions of inadequate motivation, the manager for
sales “burns out”, as a rule, after a year and a half of work. Possible and
other objective reasons for changing the employer, therefore, subsequently on
In an interview, it will be important to find out in detail why the candidate changed jobs.
The ideal sales candidate will have at least two companies on their resume,
who acted as a seller, with work experience in such companies of at least
one and a half to two years. If a candidate has frequent transitions from
company to a company with several months of experience is not recommended
inviting such a candidate for an interview.
1.3. Availability of a motivation letter
A big plus for a potential candidate will be familiarization with your
company and its products even before the interview, and a statement of your vision
sales of this product, or your interest in working with sales
this product.
2. At the interview:
2.1. Level of previous
It is recommended to ask the candidate questions:
Number of company-employer (if there were several employers, then
it is recommended to ask about the last two or three). If the candidate worked
predominantly in large organizations, he may be "bored"
work for a small company.
• Level of clients. DMP (decision makers) with whom he
communicated earlier. Here experience in large companies can be
advantage, since such organizations are focused on tangible
financial results and attraction of large key clients, therefore
"salesmen" there are stronger and more experienced. Of course, there are exceptions to this
In this case, it is necessary to analyze the sales volumes of the candidate within the framework of one or another
companies.
Key recommended question: Are you ready to work with a large number of
potential customers with a low average transaction check, or would prefer
multiple leads with large deal sizes?
2.2. Adequate self-esteem
This criterion is expressed in the cost of the candidate, in the level of his salary
expectations. If a sales manager wants to earn 15-20 thousand rubles (in
depending on the region, of course) - so this is not a sales manager. If a
the sales manager expects a monthly financial reward of
in the amount of 300 thousand rubles - this is either a brilliant sales manager (such
very little), or an inadequate person.
How do you know if a candidate's self-assessment is adequate? It is important to find out two
moment:
1. How much the candidate earned at the previous job. Perhaps his
the income was close to the amount indicated by him in the resume, then there are no questions, everything is fine
understandable. Again: if the candidate does not embellish reality. it
can be checked by looking at the vacancies of the company in which the candidate worked and
the level of payment for these vacancies, or ask the candidate for a personal income tax certificate, if
his income at the previous place of work was official.
2. It is also important to clarify the candidate's expectations in terms of the proportion of salary - bonus
component of income. If a candidate names a salary amount that is close to
expected level of income is a bad indicator. Any manager for
salesman wants to earn, so he will tie his income to
percentage of sales. During the interview process, it is important to understand whether the candidate is salary-oriented or ready to tie his financial reward to
the results achieved.
It is worth noting the following negative factor when evaluating a candidate: if the candidate
announces the amount of his monthly expenses, this may indicate his
infantilism and passive life position.
Key recommended candidate question: Do you manage to earn as much as
how much do you deserve?
2.3. Presentation Skills
This issue requires careful and comprehensive consideration. One side,
if the candidate can correctly position himself, of course, is
a plus. But it must be understood that the candidate could simply carefully
prepare for an interview, or visit enough of them before
than to come to you. On the other hand, we must not forget that the interview -
this, as a rule, is stressful for the candidate, in connection with this, he cannot always shine
bright self-presentation. Therefore, in the process of the candidate's answers, to a greater extent
attention should be paid to the structure and consistency
storytelling. Numerous negative factors should be considered
digressions, avoidance of answers, the manner of answering a question with a question, too
long story full of details.
Key recommended candidate question: Why are you interested
our job offer?
2.4. Confidence in your strength
A successful "salesperson" is full of self-confidence. He sold and sells
will sell, he, as a rule, does not have a negative sales experience, he is ready
cope with any non-standard situation, in his luggage there is everything that
necessary for effective sales. A real "salesman" will never
prepare for failure. This can be understood from the questions he asks.
If they are of an organizational nature or relate to the specifics of the product, you can
breathe freely: the candidate is not afraid of the process itself
sales. An insecure candidate asks “guaranteeing” questions. He
asks you if the customer base is provided, whether you need to do "cold
calls”, what will happen if he does not sell, who will teach him the specifics of sales of this
product - this means that he is either not quite competent, or has a negative
sales experience, or rather, “non-sales”. In a word, if the candidate's questions boil down to external factors and possible failures, it is unlikely that the true one is sitting in front of you.
salesman.
Key Suggested Question: Describe your strengths as
seller?
2.5. Excitement
Ask the candidate to talk about the most difficult transaction in his professional
experience. He will tell about it in an interesting, “delicious” way, his eyes will burn, remembering
about a recent victory. Another gambler, with high faith ness, he will start
voice possible options for finding customers to sell the company's services;
employer, potential markets where its products will be in demand
most of all, ask about the competitors of the product. He seems to be already working here, he
as if “trying on” the role of an employee, he already sees in front of him
set goals and ways to achieve them.
Key Recommended Question: How would you market our products
potential client?
2.6. Sales specifics
It should be clarified to what extent the candidate's professional experience will be integrated into the
the specifics of selling your products or services. Product and service - psychologically
different things - both for the client and for the sales manager. Often
in the resume of candidates there are organizations with different directions
activities. In this case, the risks of inefficient work in a new place
are significantly reduced. Or, if the candidate built distribution, he will be
it is difficult to carry out direct sales, as the specifics differ significantly.
Candidates with experience in FMCG (trade
representatives working in the "fields"): the level of negotiations in a given market
usually quite low. B2B and B2C sales should not be strictly separated by
levels of complexity: interaction with customers takes place at a decent level,
in both areas there is an active search for customers, in addition, B2C sales
have a relatively recent history, therefore, in the resume of candidates, the share of work
in B2C sales tends to be low.
It is also worth evaluating the cycle, dynamics and sales volumes in previous places
candidate's work. For example, in companies providing certification services
the sales cycle can be from 1 to 3 years, from negotiating to paying for services by the client. A manager who can lead a long sales cycle, with
easily cope with a short cycle, and take it with joy. sales. On the
professional experience sales dynamics affect slightly. Sales volumes
it is worth finding out to understand whether the candidate will become “bored” to make deals on
20-50 thousand rubles (5-10 thousand hryvnias), if he is used to selling more
high-priced products with fewer deals.
Key Suggested Question: What do you think is most important
factor for a potential buyer of our products to accept
buying decision?
We recommend making a decision on accepting a candidate for a job (for starters -
five-day training, after which the partner can decide that
the candidate suits him or not) after he gives a suitable partner
answers to at least 4 of the six key questions will show high skills
presentation, will clearly demonstrate the excitement in the work and show an adequate (and
corresponding to the market requirements and capabilities of the partner) financial
self-esteem. It is also recommended to evaluate potential teamwork
the seller (if he demonstrates obvious conflicting traits of character, with
they may find it difficult to work with the rest of the partner’s team), and
no obvious bad habits.
After the candidates for the job in the sales department are selected and ready to
get to work, it's time for them to adapt. In order to help our
readers, we publish in this chapter an example of an adaptation and training program,
which can be easily used in most modern companies, and
bring immediate and measurable value to your business. If you will dial
new sales department or expand an existing one, you can use these
rules (or adapt them to the specifics of your enterprise), and check whether
how much will the efficiency and effectiveness of new employees increase in
compared to how it was before.
Adaptation and training program for newcomers to the department
sales
1. Terminology
Adaptation is the process of introductory training of a new employee. Adaptation required
must be accompanied by certification - an exam following the results of training.
Certification is the process of testing the knowledge and skills of a new employee based on the results
Adaptations.
An intern is a new employee hired for a probationary period following the results of
interviews.
A mentor is an experienced employee who transfers his knowledge to the trainee and is
his curator throughout the period of adaptation.
2. General description of the adaptation process
This methodology describes the order of theoretical and practical training
interns. Adaptation of new employees consists of two stages: theoretical
adaptation and practical adaptation.
Theoretical adaptation is the training of an employee with everything necessary
theoretical aspects required for his position.
Practical adaptation is the training of an employee in the necessary practical
skills (sales and communication with partner clients) that he will need in
work process.
To increase the effectiveness of the introductory training of an employee, it is recommended to
the results of both stages of adaptation to carry out certification, according to which it will be clear
whether the employee is fit to stay with the company.
3. Internship period
Recommended at the stage of agreement with a new employee to work for
final interview. And if he doesn't give up
this exam, the company reserves the right to “say goodbye” to it, not
paying for his education. It is important to agree on this at the stage
final interview, after obtaining the consent of the employee for this approach. In that
In this case, the candidate will have maximum motivation to learn the entire
material and demonstrate their best professional qualities.
For new employees in the sales department, an adaptation period of 5 (five) is recommended
working days (full working week).
4. Administration of the onboarding process
In order for the onboarding process to be structured, it is essential to assign
a mentor from the company's employees responsible for leading the trainee through
learning process. The task of this employee is to know the structure and schedule
training programs, on what day and at what time who and what should tell
or show the trainee and organize these training activities. Also
this employee is the key contact person to whom
contact the trainee in case of any questions during the process
learning. Such an employee can even be a sales manager or HR manager.
manager. Ideally, to mentor new employees (trainees) of the department
Sales was the head of the sales department.
Approximate training schedule for a sales intern:
09:00 - 10:00 - face-to-face communication of the mentor (leader) with the trainee (trainees),
setting tasks for the day. Answers on questions.
10:00 - 10:15 assignment for the trainee tasks for the day.
10:15 - 17:00 manager performs tasks. Independent and collective work
to study the company's products or services and sales techniques.
17:00 - 18:00 face-to-face communication of a mentor (supervisor) with interns, verification
completing tasks, answering questions, working out speech patterns and scripts in
form of role-playing games. Homework.
It is recommended during the period of training and adaptation of the trainee to use
the following training modules:
1. Acquaintance with the company, the market in which it operates,
products/services, prices and competitors.
2. Acquaintance with the stages of the company's sales, studying the sales funnel.
3. Acquaintance with sales standards, tactics and negotiation scripts.
4. Role play with a mentor or colleagues at various stages of sales, with
using sales scripts (for example, working out acquaintance with
client, presentation skills, and objection handling tactics).</p>
