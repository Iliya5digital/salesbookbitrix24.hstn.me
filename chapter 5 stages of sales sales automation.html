<body>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss:
1. What is a sales funnel.
2. How to work with leads and deals.
3. How can you automate the different stages of sales - and how in this
Bitrix24.CRM can help.
So, your company already has a sales department. You approved functional
duties of its employees, recruited the required number of salespeople, trained
them. You have a client base and you know how to grow it. You have enabled CRM.
What's next? The point is small - it remains to properly configure the work of your
sellers at every stage of the sales funnel.
1. Sales funnel.
Let's start with basic concepts.
A lead is someone who is only interested. He might be a potential client
however, may also never become a customer.
The buyer (participant in the transaction) has already made his choice in your
benefit, and works with you as part of a specific transaction.
A deal is a negotiation process with a buyer, which is accompanied by
preparation of a commercial offer, invoicing, conclusion
contracts, control of payments by the buyer. Like a lead, a deal can be
lost (the buyer can refuse the purchase).
A sales funnel is a set of stages through which either a lead passes (from the moment
the first contact with your company until confirmation of interest in a deal with
you), or a potential client (from the moment the transaction is opened until the moment of purchase).
Accordingly, you can have several sales funnels - a funnel for work
with leads and/or a funnel for working with deals.
At the first stage of the sales funnel, there is always a certain amount
interested parties (leads or contacts), the latter - as a rule, much
fewer buyers. Therefore, the term "sales funnel" is very easy to visualize - at the top of the funnel, as a rule, is always wider than at the bottom. At
this is the funnel length and the number of stages (sales stages) of which it consists,
can vary significantly for different types of business and areas of activity
enterprises.
So, for example, for a retail store, the number of such stages will be very
small:
1. Customers entered the store.
2. Visitors have chosen the desired products.
3. Visitors left with a purchase.
Managing such a sales process is quite simple - firstly, you need not
scare potential buyers (empty shelves, unpleasant smell,
rude sellers) so that they do not immediately leave the outlet. Second, if
customers may need help choosing products, the store
there should be a sufficient number of consultants who are well versed
in the products offered and ready to help customers make their choice. Thirdly,
the store needs to be equipped with cash desks and cashiers who can accept payment from
buyers.
But what to do when it comes to more complex sales - for example, sales
consumables from a wholesale company? In this situation, the number of stages
sales will be much more:
1. Formation of a potential client base, obtaining new leads.
2. Contacts with potential clients, identification of decision makers (persons receiving
purchasing decision).
3. Identification of the needs of potential customers.
4. Presentation and preparation of a commercial offer.
5. Negotiations, overcoming objections.
6. Issuing an invoice, concluding an agreement.
7. Control of payment and shipment.
8. Repeat or regular sales.
And there may be even more complex examples of sales when, in order to close a deal,
creation of an expert group, preparation of terms of reference,
project approval ... In this case, the stages of the sales funnel may turn out to be
even more. Be that as it may, the main task of the seller in any case will be
control over the timely and consistent completion of the transaction at all stages
sales funnels. This simple and clear truth will help so many sellers.
understand your role - to accompany the client on the way to purchase in a quality manner. Length
this path depends on how the sales process is built in your company -
does it start at the moment the lead is received, or does your firm try to
start closing deals with potential customers.
When should you work with leads?
In the first chapter of our Book, we already talked about several types of sales - in
in particular, depending on the simplicity or complexity of the sales process, or the quantity
stages in the sales funnel. Recall that such sales are:
1. Simple (or transactional - from the word "transaction", payment).
The potential buyer has already made his choice, and he only needs to
pay money for a product or service. These can be, for example:
• purchases in a store or website,
• going to a restaurant or cinema,
• a haircut at a hairdresser's and other simple household services.
The role of the seller in such transactions is mainly related to the acceptance of payment from
buyer.
2. Consulting. The potential buyer has decided on a set
suppliers/vendors and needs help or advice from
seller to make the final choice. Only after receiving what
consultation or presentation he will decide on the purchase. It could be:
• buying a car,
• selection of a supplier of raw materials or consumables,
• ordering services for business,
• medical, legal, educational services.
The role of the seller in such sales is more significant, from his efforts, activity and
professionalism will largely depend on the choice of the buyer.
Strategic (project). Purchase configuration can be very
complex, the number of sales stages is very large. These are large
construction, technological projects, implementation of complex information
systems. The role of the seller in such sales is especially important in the early stages.
(when you need to arouse interest among decision makers on the choice
strategic supplier).
Companies that make most of their sales simple (transactional) are quite
can do without working with leads. The number of sales stages that will be in
their case, will be very small (1-2 stages). For example:
1. Receiving a visitor.
2. Control of payment and shipment of goods (or - provision of services and payment).
In such situations, your firm can immediately create a deal in CRM with
potential client, and work with him through the stages of the transaction. In Bitrix24.CRM
you can make a choice and work without leads in principle (every time you
When a new incoming request occurs, a new one will be automatically created
deal).
If, in your case, the number of contacts with a potential client is up to
purchases are large, if the transaction goes through several stages, then it makes sense
build work with leads, and with the help of your salespeople and stage automation
sales turn them into deals.
Why use leads, build a separate funnel for them and make
more actions in CRM? The answer is simple: want your recruitment efforts to
customers gave a greater return and there were more customers? Use
every opportunity. Even if the potential client has not confirmed his
initial interest (told you "expensive" or "I'm looking for the same, but with
mother-of-pearl buttons). Save such an interested customer in CRM
- and in the future you will be able to offer him a product that is suitable for the price, if you have one
will appear. Or show him your Vkontakte ad: he will see your
announcement (for example, about a promotion, about a new product, that your product is better than that of
others) in his Vkontakte feed, will gradually remember your company, and in the end -
eventually may want to buy from you.
What if right now you don’t have time to boost such leads, that’s all.
efforts and resources directed to sales? Working with leads in Bitrix24.CRM
can be turned off without worrying that they will disappear. All your touches with the client,
all leads will still get into Bitrix24.CRM, but will immediately appear in transactions. This
the method was specially invented in order to simplify the work at the first stage. BUT
that's when you decide that it's time to squeeze the maximum out of all incoming - return
You can work with leads in one click!
2. Work with leads.
So, let's say that your company uses lead generation in the sales process.
As a result of this work, the following can happen to the lead:
1. It can be converted into a deal (confirm your interest in buying),
while the client himself will also be present in CRM as a contact (or
company).
2. Maybe the customer is not ready to buy now. Then the transaction does not open,
but there may still be a contact of a potential client who
is of interest to your organization in the future.
3. A lead can be recognized as “poor quality”:
• if he is not clearly prepared to discuss any possible deals in
the future. Such leads still should not be deleted immediately, they can be
use for future advertising campaigns.
• or if his contact details or information about the lead is out of date.
Such leads should be deleted immediately.
Suppose your company has become the proud owner of some
the number of leads. Most likely you got them from some online channels
(for example, through Open Lines in Bitrix24.CRM, or by mailing to
email), or your company just receives incoming calls from
new contacts. What to do with them next?
To get started, you need:
1. Determine the number of stages through which leads will pass in
processing. These stages may be:
• call or email to the lead for confirmation and clarification
contacts or meeting invitations identifying the needs of the lead (confirmation of his interest in
cooperation with your company, or a one-time purchase of your goods
or services)
• qualification of the lead (transferring it to the stage of a transaction, waiting or recognition
poor quality).
2. Determine the criteria by which leads will be converted (into deals
or contacts), remain in processing (pending), or will be recognized
poor quality. These criteria can be:
• for conversion into a deal – a meeting with a client (confirmation of
existence and interest in cooperation with your company in
next moment), additional detailed requests from him
(for example, a request to send a commercial offer or an invoice to
payment).
• for further processing of the lead, the client subscribes to an electronic
mailing your company, or his request to make a phone call
with questions later (for example, in a week or a month).
• to recognize a lead as low-quality - unconfirmed contact
data, a negative reaction from the lead to communication with your
employees, please remove him from the mailing list or do not call
more.
3. Determine the time frame during which the lead must pass to the next
stage, or be found to be of poor quality. For example, to recognize a lead
poor quality, it can be a month during which the lead does not respond
phone calls (or a certain number of unanswered
calls).
4. Automate the lead processing process.
Lead Automation
In the previous chapter on CRM, we talked about how Bitrix24.CRM
sales automation is provided using special tools -
robots and triggers. If for some reason you missed the chapter on CRM, then
we strongly recommend that you read it first, and only after that
return to current content. And here we will show you some
opportunities for automated work with leads that are able to perform
without any participation of the manager of the robots inside Bitrix24.CRM.
To begin with, let's give an example of a basic script for automated work with
leads of a company that receives completed questionnaires (CRM forms). Let's say
that this company is engaged in teaching English, and through such questionnaires
accepts an appointment for a free (trial) English lesson.
The script for working with a lead will include:
1. As soon as a potential candidate for training fills out the form and clicks
the "Submit" button, a new lead will appear in CRM, and it will be assigned
responsible manager.
2. The candidate who fills out the form will immediately receive an email
with standard text (Thank you, we received your application for a free
occupation. Our specialist will call you back within one working hour,
to agree on the time and place of the lesson).
3. The manager to whom this lead was assigned will have a task in CRM
(case) – call the lead back. In this case, the manager will see that this
the potential client has already received a letter from the company. Straight from the card
the lead manager will press the "Call" button and dial the contact number.
4. The manager will clarify whether the name and surname of the potential
client, and agree with him a convenient time for a free lesson. date and time
meetings will be immediately recorded in CRM, and after the end of the conversation
the lead will automatically change the status to “Deal” and move on to the first stage
new sales funnel (for deals). The client after the end of the conversation
will receive an SMS stating the place and time of the free class, and
a second email, with the same information and
offer to subscribe to the email newsletter.
5. A client who went (or could not go) to a free lesson immediately
after that, he will begin to see the Internet (for example, VKontakte, or advertising
Yandex blocks) advertising this school of English, with an offer
buy courses.
The only thing the manager needed to do in this scenario was
it's just to dial a phone number inside the CRM, after a new urgent
tasks. Everything else was done by robots from Bitrix24.CRM. And such scenarios for
work with leads or deals, you can create a very large number. robots
from CRM Bitrix24 can automatically perform a fairly large number of
actions related to the setting of tasks for sales staff,
possibilities of communication with the client or advertising activities.
Here is how you can use robots from Bitrix24.CRM for automation
processing leads (and even deals) in your business:
1. To launch robots, you need to have stages configured in your CRM
sales (they can be configured separately for leads and deals). If you wish, you
you can use the automatically configured stages from
Bitrix24.CRM.
2. For each robot, you have the ability to set the response time
(a kind of "alarm clock"). The robot can start to act:
2.1. “Immediately” – as soon as the lead (or deal) enters a certain status. If you
put several robots with the “immediately” parameter, then they will all work at the moment
transition document to this status.
2.2. "After the previous" - if you need to build a strict chain of actions,
then this parameter will allow not to execute the robot until it has worked
previous. For example, you need to call the client back only after
a letter will be sent.
2.3. "Through ..." - the most popular parameter that will allow you to build a whole
the process of processing a lead on one status. You can specify the number of minutes
hours or days after which the robot will work. For example, after sending an email
call the client back in 1 day and find out if he is interested in the offer.
After 2 days, send a second letter and so on. The chain may contain
as many robots as you want and each will perform some action through
the specified number of minutes, hours, or days.
3. Robots can perform actions in various directions:
3.1. Assign tasks to sales staff. It can be:
• call planning
• scheduling a meeting
• other task
• a letter with a notification about the need to control the situation with leads
• change of the employee responsible for the lead
• changing the status of a lead (converting to a deal, deleting)
3.2. Reach out to leads/customers on your own. It could be:
• sending SMS with pre-prepared text
• sending an e-mail (where the text, of course, is also ready in advance).
3.3. Showing online ads to customers. The robot can add a client to ads
campaigns of your organization (this can be advertising on VKontakte, Yandex, Facebook
or Google AdWords). It should be clarified that the robot does not launch advertising campaigns
independently, it only adds contacts of the lead or client to the lists of those
audiences that see your business's ads on these ad networks
(or specially created new audiences). 3.4. In addition to robots, Bitrix24.CRM has an automation process using
triggers. These are a kind of electronic spies that are triggered by some
then an active action on the part of the lead, and independently move his status along
sales funnel or processing stages as needed. Triggers can
react to:
• Incoming mail
• Incoming call
• Filling out a CRM form
• Message to Open Lines
• Visit of a potential client
Note that not all CRMs today can offer their customers such
opportunities for sales automation, such as working with robots or triggers for
different stages of working with leads or deals. Therefore, we advise that you
used a modern and efficient CRM system in their work, such as
Bitrix24.CRM.
Guidelines for working with leads
What recommendations can help readers of this Book at the stages of working with
leads? We have tried to select the key points that make it possible
respond effectively and promptly
1. Regardless of lead generation channels, leads should immediately fall into
CRM. In the previous chapter, we discussed in detail how
Bitrix24.CRM can connect most of the channels through which your
the company collects leads (phone, email, online chat, various
feedback forms and appeals in social networks and instant messengers, orders
callback clients from the site). If this is not done, then the percentage of losses
leads at the first stage will be very high.
2. Each lead must have a responsible person - the task of this person is
communication with the lead, verification of contact details, clarification of information and
preliminary identification of needs.
• If at this stage it becomes clear that this lead is a target one, and
interest leads to the purchase of your company's products or services - convert
such a lead into a deal and work with him already at the stages of the deal.
• If the lead turns out to be non-targeted or of poor quality, it can either be immediately
delete, or (if such a potential client has no interest in your products at the moment, but with the prospect of this
interest in the future), you can continue to interact with him with
using promotional tools, without the participation of a sales manager.
• Well, what if the person responsible for processing the lead “gaps” and does not fulfill his
work - quickly change it to another contact person from your
companies. And best of all - automatically.
3. Automate the process of processing leads as much as possible - set tasks for
of your employees when a lead passes through certain stages, use
automatic communication with the lead (sending SMS or email),
turn on advertising campaigns to “warm up” the lead’s interest (by adding a lead
to the ad audiences you interact with).
In fact, Bitrix24.CRM will help you with all these actions. You will not have to
collect leads from different channels in different programs (all of them will be inside
a single CRM), there will be no need to assign a person responsible for each lead (CRM will
it automatically), and you can assign a variety of automatic
scenarios for processing leads using robots included in CRM.
4. And one more important advice. As we said before, a lead can become a deal, and may not be. The "conversion" indicator determines the percentage of those leads,
who confirmed their initial interest and continued the dialogue with
your company (became deals). Let's say you get a hundred leads in a month,
of which your sellers were able to create twenty deals - conversion
will be exactly twenty percent.
Why should you track this metric? If the lead processing conversion on
the first stage (for example, a call to a potential client and clarification of his
interest) will be minimal (for example, below 5 percent), it will become obvious
that the company receives not very high-quality leads. It might be a problem
marketing department (incorrectly configured advertising campaigns) - and sellers
will spend a lot of time connecting and communicating with those who did not initially
planned to buy.
If the conversion is at the first stage (when the lead confirms his interest)
will be quite high (for example, those same 20 percent), but
subsequent stages of work with these clients (already at the stages of the transaction) it turns out that
that transactions do not occur, then it will be necessary to understand the quality of work
sellers. It is possible that they provide poor quality support for such transactions, not
they know how to present your products qualitatively or overcome objections.
Both the manager and the leader can analyze such statistics.
sales department (using reports from CRM).
Dealing with deals.
A pleasant event happened - the client confirmed his interest, and leads
purchase negotiations with your company. As we said at the beginning of the chapter, in
CRM such activity is defined as a deal. What needs to be done to
managers qualitatively worked out possible deals at each stage
sales? Let's look at the most popular stages of the transaction:
1. The deal has been created.
2. The deal is in progress (negotiations and discussions are underway).
3. An offer/invoice for payment has been sent to the client.
4. Deal won (payment completed).
either
5. The deal is lost (the client refused).
1. Where will deals appear in your CRM?
If your company has made a decision for itself to work without leads, then transactions
appear in CRM automatically (when there are incoming requests from
potential customers), or will be created manually by managers (from
existing contacts or companies). In this case, there will be
automatic conversion of all incoming leads immediately into deals using
robots from Bitrix24.CRM.
If you continue to work with leads, the deals will be converted
managers manually (from leads, contacts or companies), or the leads will also be
turn into transactions with the help of robots (upon the occurrence of conditions that you
installed in your CRM).
2. You can set the direction of the transaction in CRM. Many companies are doing
several lines of business at the same time (for example, they sell ready-made
furniture, make custom-made furniture and repair furniture). For
each of these areas may have its own stages of processing
transactions (and own robots that automate the processing of such transactions)
– and all this you can also set up in CRM. In Bitrix24.CRM for this
there are directories where you can describe the stages of transaction processing for
various directions). Later, for each of the directions of transactions it will be possible to
build your own analytical reports or watch the sales funnel.
3. Processing of each transaction (negotiations with the client, preparation of commercial
proposals, negotiation and conclusion of a contract, acceptance of payment) may consist
from a different number of intermediate stages. This will depend on the specifics
your business. However, no matter how many such stages or steps you have identified for
yourself - each of them can and should be automated inside CRM.
You can also do this with the help of robots from Bitrix24.CRM, work and
the possibilities of which we have already described a little higher. The most important stage
transaction processing will be processes assigned to the task manager in connection with
client (meetings, calls, letters), and automatic CRM actions (sending
SMS to the client with order confirmation, issuing and sending an invoice for payment). AT
as a result of this automatic configuration, CRM will manage the actions
manager and signal to the head of the sales department about those cases and tasks
that are not completed on time.
4. As part of each transaction, your manager can put offers to the client
(which can be created on the basis of ready-made templates, and personalized according to
client) and invoices. As a rule, such an action means automatic or
manual transfer of a transaction with a client to the penultimate stage (before the transaction
actually won). However, you need to understand that the work of a manager with a client
at this stage is very important - after all, the transaction may not take place, even if
invoice issued. Therefore, both the manager and the head of the sales department
you need to pay great attention in CRM to such customers (keep on a special
control of transactions that are already close to payment or shipment, establish a clear
call time nkov and letters to customers if payment was not made on time) - and bring
transactions to their logical conclusion.
4. Work with accounts. Acceptance of payments.
A large number of companies (including representatives of small and medium
businesses) accept payments from customers to their bank accounts. To
such payment has occurred, it is necessary to issue an invoice to the client for payment. And this too
can and should be done inside CRM!
Bitrix24.CRM provides very convenient and simple settings for
issuing and sending invoices to customers and receiving payments from them:
1. Basic invoice templates. All necessary information about your company
(payment details, address, contact details), which will be
displayed in the invoice, is configured directly in Bitrix24.CRM. Add
such information will be needed only once, and then each new
the customer will be billed from CRM with a simple click of a button.
Printed or electronic version of the invoice with the client's details. if you
you need to add the payer's details to the invoice - they are also not necessary
enter manually. Provided that such details are included in the card
customer in CRM, they can be billed with one click.
Further, such an invoice can be printed and saved electronically.
3. Automatic numbering of accounts within CRM, which makes it possible
support end-to-end numbering with accounts in 1C. Managers don't need
assign account numbers manually, CRM will do it for them.
4. Online invoices (the ability for the client to view, download or
print, and even pay your bill directly from the Internet, by
personal link generated by Bitrix24). It's very convenient and
allows you to send your customer a web link to the invoice itself.
5. Online payments (using Yandex.checkout or PayPal services). Capabilities
online payments using the Yandex.kassa service will be especially useful for
small businesses, as they allow you to accept payments for small
amounts (up to 15 thousand rubles inclusive) without concluding an agreement with
payment system. At the same time, the number of such payments can be
unlimited - only the amount of one payment is important. Of course, payments
online will be immediately displayed in CRM.
6. Integration with 1C (which we already talked about in the previous chapter) - unloading
issued invoices from Bitrix24.CRM in 1C, control of payments of such invoices on
side 1C, and putting down information about payments in CRM.
7. Regular accounts. If your contract with a client involves permanent
purchases from his side (for example, monthly), you can immediately set up
automatic issuance of recurring invoices.
As you can see, Bitrix24.CRM allows you to turn invoicing work
or accepting payments in a very simple process. All that remains for the manager
sales is to control the timing of payment of the invoice, and contact the client if
For some reason, the payment did not occur on time. To control the passage
accounts in Bitrix24.CRM also provides for setting up several stages (to
example - Invoice issued, sent to the client, paid or rejected), and the manager
will be able to see reports on the status of his accounts.
5. Repeat and regular sales
Many customers buy something from your company more than once. If
manager has a very good memory - perhaps he will remember the history of previous
purchases upon receipt of a request from an old customer. But is it really worth hoping for this - especially if you have not one or two, but hundreds or thousands of active
clients?
Of course, Bitrix24.CRM is the best assistant here as well. At
receiving a request or a lead from a client, CRM will immediately check whether they bought something
then earlier this customer (and will determine which sales funnel it should be assigned to -
new or repeat business).
If the client has not even bought anything yet, but is already present in your
customer base, then CRM will create a repeat lead from an existing contact (when
call, letter or other form of communication).
Why is it important to pay attention to repeat sales?
1. The more and more often an individual customer buys from you, the stronger the need
build relationships with such customers (including with the help of sellers
and CRM systems). They are the basis of your business, the guarantee of your profit.
Active buyers need to be contacted more often on your own
initiative, make them special marketing offers, arrange for
them promotions or encourage them to new purchases through loyalty programs.
2. You can segment your customer base with a custom RFM
analysis. This analysis helps to understand:
2.1. How long ago customers bought from you last time (R = Recency, prescription).
2.2. How often customers shopped with you (F=Frequency).
2.3. How much money customers have spent on your products or services (M=Monetary,
monetization).
Based on this analysis, you can identify the most promising
clients, and to intensify the work of managers with them.
For example:
• Your company delivers bottled water. Are you good
know that on average your client drinks a bottle of water in three days Means,
if a regular customer ordered five bottles, then in about two weeks
The drinking water ordered from you will run out. Managers can't wait
new order, and send SMS (using a robot) or call him back for
one or two days before the end of such a period, and offer to issue a new
order.
• Your firm sells business or educational books. With CRM, you
highlight the segment of customers who have bought books over the past year
often enough (for example, every month), and encourage them to the next
purchase by a special protocol (for loyalty to your company).
You are the owner of the service station. You are approached by a client who, over the past two years,
spent a large amount on your service (say, one hundred thousand rubles). For
encouraging and strengthening loyalty to such a client, your service station can immediately
offer him a free car wash (which you don't usually do)
or some other nice bonus. And you can do the same
only with an incoming request, but also send such an offer to the client
automatically (by letter, sms, manager's call), which will help you again
robots.
Bitrix24.CRM perfectly comes to the aid of sellers even when
the buyer originally planned to buy something from your company constantly
(regularly). In the previous paragraph, we already talked about the possibility of setting
regular invoices - for example, you signed a contract for a monthly shipment
some product. In order not to distract the seller's time for issuing repeated
accounts, in CRM it will be enough to mark such a transaction as a regular one and set
signs of this regularity. Further, strictly in the designated period, CRM will
independently issue invoices to this client (and even be able to send them to him
to an email address). The manager will only have to check
timeliness of payment by the client of the invoice (recall that in the case of integration with 1C,
payment mark will appear automatically) - and contact the client for clarification
information if something goes wrong.
Let's summarize this chapter.
As you can see, at each stage of sales (work with leads, deals, invoices or
repeated payments) the seller will work more efficiently and easily using
CRM capabilities. Let's take another example - a company that provides
printing business cards and printing services.
In a day, several dozen potential candidates can apply to such a firm.
clients. They can:
- make a phone call
- place an order through the website
- come to the office of the company and order business cards on the spot
In each of the cases described, a firm that is engaged in operational
printing industry, you will need to have a scenario for working with clients - at what point and
what information you need to get from them, how to accept an advance payment,
Of course, after ordering a business card, you will also need:
- prepare designs and layouts,
type,
- inform the client about readiness
- transfer printed business cards (or send by mail).
Imagine if all these actions are manually controlled by the seller (and he will
keep records of each stage of work with clients either in a notebook or in
spreadsheets) - what chaos can begin with the growth of client
appeals? If such a company uses Bitrix24.CRM, then:
- none of the client requests will be lost anywhere, and will be processed,
and on time
- for all orders, responsible for the execution and control will be appointed
- all orders from customers that are at different stages of processing will be
clearly visible to both salespeople and the manager
- sellers do not have to remember with which of the customers and on what occasion they need to
contact within what time frame - CRM will tell him the correct course of action.
- customers will receive automatic notifications of status changes
orders (for example, business cards are ready, you can pick them up) by e-mail or
via SMS
The possibilities of sales automation included in Bitrix24.CRM on various
stages of the sales funnel (for leads or deals) help to make all actions in
in relation to the client on time, without difficulties and wasted time. AT
As a result, together with Bitrix24.CRM, sellers can work less (than their
colleagues, forced to be torn between many different programs and spend
a lot of time for manual processes), and earn more!</p>
