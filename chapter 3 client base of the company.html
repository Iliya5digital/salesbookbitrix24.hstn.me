<title>salesbook - Chapter 3. Client base of the company</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In this chapter, we will talk about:
1. What is the client base of a modern company.
2. What are the sources of formation and increase in the client base.
3. What channels of communication with clients can managers use
sales department.
Perhaps you still remember those times when in every second announcement about
vacancy for a sales manager indicated the requirement “a salesperson is needed
with your client base? Or maybe you meet such vacancies and
today? This is a clear example of how closely the work of a sales manager
linked to the company's customer base.
It is very easy to understand why this is so - imagine working in a store that does not
knows nothing about his clients. The seller has to rely only on the fact that
potential buyers will not pass by the place of his work, but will be interested
a beautiful sign or cute mannequins, and they will look at him. If this
does not happen by itself - then the seller's only hope will be that
miracles of advertising or the activity of street promoters handing out leaflets with
the name and address of the stores (or the magic word is SALE with a discount
70 percent), will still lead visitors to his store. Well, what if this
hope is not destined to come true? Sales will not take place, as there will be sales
just nobody.
Now imagine another situation in which the seller or owner
store know the names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses of those customers who
Have purchased from them at least once. What if they have the information and don't
only about such loyal customers, but also about those potential customers who
theoretically interested in the goods sold in this store? Before
the owner of such a business opens up much more opportunities for
customer acquisition, right?
But you and I do not need to strain ourselves especially to present the second
situation - that's how modern business works. If it's retail
trade, then buyers (and even just guests of the outlet) all the time
issue loyalty program cards, for which it is enough
fill out a form with contact details, if this is a wholesale business, then in it
scrupulously record the data of both existing and potential customers. If this is a service industry, then the value of a mobile phone number to which you can
send sms or call back, future or real customer every year
is getting bigger and bigger. And many companies (to go far for examples
not necessary - taxi services and fitness centers do this regularly) try
attract customers by sending bulk SMS to the numbers of all
mobile phones that they managed to get. What to say about addresses
Email….
So, let's define the concept - what is a customer base?
This is an array of data about consumers of products or services, which may include
contact information, as well as information about the history of relationships
(negotiations, purchases, payments) between such buyers and the base owner.
Let's explore the possible customer base formats:
1. Depending on the storage medium, the client base may be in
digital (electronic) or printed form. The second - in our time already
a real rarity, however, even today there are often companies, information
about whose clients is not digitized in any way, and is stored exclusively in paper
form. We hope you don't? If for some reason your company
was also included in this number, we strongly recommend as soon as possible
transfer your client database to electronic form. If you are concerned
data storage security, and you trust paper archives more - then
remember that it is very easy to steal or set fire to printed materials, and
to ensure reliable storage of digital data in our time is enough
easily.
2. The client base may include exclusively data on existing
clients of the company (it will be rather a base of counterparties) - or represent
from itself a wider array of information, in which you can also find
potential buyers (who in any way indicated their interests
or the need for goods / services that the base owner sells). If your
the customer base consists only of the number of those who have previously made purchases from you -
then you can communicate and interact only with
existing customers, and the disadvantages of this situation are obvious. If your base
gives you the opportunity to work actively with those potential
customers who are not yet your customers - you are much more
favorable situation.
3. You can be the owner of the database of individuals or legal entities. This
factor is important when you work in the b2b market (in that case, the base of private
consumers will be practically useless for you). Note that the base legal entities will be incomplete if it contains only information about
enterprises, but there are no detailed contact details - names and surnames of persons
decision makers (DM), their job titles, personal
contact details (work phone numbers and addresses of the corporate
Email). Such a database will be more of a reference for study
which the seller will have to work very hard.
4. The completeness of the client base depends on the availability of detailed contacts of your
customers (again, we can talk about both existing customers and
future customers). The most complete client base contains:
• surnames and names (if necessary - and patronymics),
• various phone numbers (mobile, work) and e-mail
(personal and corporate),
• data about profiles in social networks and used digital
messengers (Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram and even icq, which is still
still use it),
• address data,
• sources and channels for getting contact data into the database,
• and even financial information (payment details of legal entities,
data on issued/paid invoices and contracts, billing details) according to
existing clients.
5. Relevant or irrelevant. All of the above parameters are subject to change -
private consumers move, change phone numbers, employees
companies are changing jobs, and the companies themselves are changing names, areas
activities and sometimes shut down. On average, a contact is considered relevant,
which was confirmed (according to the parameters of interest to the database owner) not
more than six months ago, but there are also types of businesses in which
the relevance of contacts is measured in weeks or days.
I think our readers will agree that the most effective to use
the client base will be:
1. Exist digitally.
2. Include not only current, but also potential customers
companies.
3. Complete - contain a maximum of contact information, according to
Opportunities – include marketing and financial details.
4. Up-to-date.
5. Regularly replenished and increasing. We specifically added this
an important point, since a business cannot be static - there is always
there are new players and new promising customers. And for the owner
bases need to be able to reach out to such future customers -
and, therefore, they should get into his client base.
Sources of customer base formation
Having defined the criteria for a quality customer base, let's discuss
how you can replenish it, and do it without sacrificing quality.
There are several standard ways to increase the base of potential customers:
1. Using all possible advertising channels for lead generation.
2. Purchase of formed (according to your requirements and needs) client bases, or
the same "parsing" of existing databases from the Internet.
3. "Cold calls" on contacts available in open sources
(directories, telephone databases) in order to clarify contacts and
identify potential interest.
The first one is definitely. more the responsibility of the department
marketing than the sales department - and yet we will pay attention to the marketing
activity, calculated to increase the client base, in this chapter. When we
we are talking about an effective sales department, we are obliged to evaluate those channels
attracting customers who give the maximum result - and active
marketing in this sense is the most reliable assistant to the seller.
For example, your sales team can significantly increase its customer base
thanks to:
1. Electronic applications (leads) and calls from your site.
2. All kinds of Internet marketing methods, designed not only for
increase in traffic (number of visitors), but also on lead generation (the process of obtaining contact details of individuals or businesses interested in any
your suggestions, ideas, materials, or specific products/services).
This may include:
• contextual advertising (in search engines and large advertising networks),
• targeted advertising (in social networks, advertising networks and targeted
websites), email marketing (e-mail newsletters),
• holding webinars (conferences and seminars directly in
Internet),
• content marketing (publication on the Internet of various interesting and useful
reading materials, which generally require
leave contact details)
• SMM (marketing activity in social networks - maintaining groups, business
pages, communities and publics),
• registration on various online marketplaces, bulletin boards and
price aggregators.
Of course, we have not listed all the possibilities - but you can
compare them with those channels of advertising and activity on the Internet, which are currently
moment apply in your company and draw conclusions.
3. Participation in various events (exhibitions, conferences, seminars, fairs,
open days, etc.) - and you can both be part of the ongoing
anyone events, and organize their own essential.
4. Conduct free (or shareware) demonstrations of features
of your product in various showrooms and points of sale, distribution of promotional
materials and samples of goods or the provision of services, the ability to order
free samples. This is a rather expensive way of promotion, however, in
cases with many physical consumer goods (for example -
food products. who offer a free try in shopping
centers or restaurants), as well as various services (for example, services
sports centers where free training is offered to those who wish) it
works very well.
5. Inviting potential customers to participate in the loyalty program
(design of cards for such a program). Even if the potential client
having issued a card, he will not buy anything yet, you will already have his contact details.
6. Advertising in traditional media - TV advertising, radio, press and outdoor advertising.
Such promotion leads to an increase in the recognition of your
brand, and count on an active increase in the number of leads (calls,
requests) when it is applied is far from always realistic.
7. Recommendation services and word of mouth. If you find an opportunity
use your existing customers to refer their friends and
acquaintances - you will win. Many companies provide
free periods of time or even real goods to those of your customers,
who recommended this company to other people, and they made purchases.
Often a free first purchase (usually in the service industry)
applies to a new client who came on the recommendation of a friend, already
being a client.
In fact, of course, we have listed far from all marketing tools,
which are used for lead generation and growth of client bases. Listed above
the most popular methods, and their active use will help your
business to grow, and your salespeople to get more leads, with
with which they can work.
Of course, sellers can be engaged in sales without marketing, as such.
The company can buy ready-made customer bases (which were previously created by someone
then others), can use the technology of "parsing" (with the help of special
software products download contacts from various sites - for example, whiteboards
ads, marketplaces, etc.), and may also land sellers or
call center operators for telephone calls to contacts that can be
openly found in various sources (both on the Internet and in printed
reference books). However, the result of such communication will almost always be the first
contact with a person who may not have heard anything about your firm, your
products, and showed no interest in it. Considering that such
a lot of people are engaged in phone calls, the reaction of your subscriber
predicted to be at least cool, and most likely negative. Your
sellers will spend a lot of time, but the result of sales for such a base
may be very low. Another thing is when a potential customer already knows about you, and has shown
little interest in your business, your services or products. Build
dialogue with such an interlocutor is much easier for the seller, and the likelihood of a transaction
will increase significantly. Therefore, we recommend increasing your client
base primarily through those tools that will provide you with an active
and stable lead generation - in other words, the process of obtaining new
contact details of individuals or legal entities that have expressed any
interest in your marketing messages.
Channels of communication with clients

The hardest part of the job of a modern sales force is not to

build a client base. As we said, today is a huge job in

in this direction is done by the marketing department, providing sellers with ready-made bases

potential and prospective customers. But in the sales process, inevitably

there is a lost profit - it seems that there is someone to sell, but there is no result.

Perhaps this has happened in your company as well - the seller has several

hundreds of possible clients, and real deals are made two or three, or even none at all

one. Of course, sales managers can always find an explanation

low results - high prices (and competitors have lower!), low discounts (and

customers demand more), a difficult market situation (as if everyone stopped

buy) and much more. However, the truth turns out to be

next, sales people are missing out on a huge amount of

opportunities that open up in front of them in the process of working with the client

base. For some potential buyers, they do not respond in time to inquiries,

others - they call with untimely or insufficiently developed

sentences, and they completely forget about the third ones.

If you, as a business owner, company manager or department head

sales, want to effectively manage the work of your sales department - you

inevitably you will have to take control of the communication channels of your managers

with all possible customers - both existing and potential. Not,

this does not mean that you have to create a second sales department, the task

which will be to check each action (or inaction)

"first" section. To plant overseers behind the back of sellers is an idea

hopeless. All you need is to create a single workspace for sellers

environment (or, as they say - Workflow) for working with clients.

Let's see how your sales managers can communicate,

meet and negotiate with clients
1. By phone. These can be work (corporate) phone numbers,

or personal (mobile) numbers of the sales managers themselves.

2. By e-mail - again, both corporate and personal.

3. At personal meetings - in your office, in the client's office, at various business

events.

4. In messengers or social networks. I hope this didn't shock you.

paragraph? In fact, many sales managers

prefer Skype to communicating with clients by phone (and their clients in this

often support), and they can communicate both in chat mode and

voice communication.

5. Through telepathic communication - the exchange of thoughts. Confess - here

we were joking, of course, but there is some truth in every joke. Highly

often sales managers convince their managers that exactly

know what their client thinks, what conclusions he made and what decisions

going to accept. True, subsequent events very often refute

manager's assumptions, and force us to conclude that in fact

telepathic communication in sales has not yet been proven by anyone.

And how to control whether everything was done correctly or on time by the manager

sales if he can and send his customer an e-mail

mail, and call back from your mobile, and agree on the terms of the transaction at a meeting,

in which no one else took part ... Who is able to track all these

numerous contacts with buyers, and conclude what actions

the seller were effective, and which ones were not?

An unequivocal answer - both to the heads of sales departments and to the sales managers themselves

sales, and the owners of companies in this helps the CRM system. How and what

way - you will read in the next chapter!</p>
