<body>
<p>In this chapter you will read about:
1. What phrases and speech patterns will help your salespeople.
2. How best to receive incoming calls - and call customers yourself.
3. How to overcome standard objections in negotiations with clients.
When you first started reading the first chapter, you came across the statement that
sales is a business process. Every process has its inherent
elements and algorithms that the process owner creates and models in advance,
not at the time of implementation. Just imagine what would happen if
car manufacturers would decide what configuration the new
serial car directly on the conveyor - and for each
car would be a new fresh idea? Most likely, the output turned out
there would be a bunch of curious, but not working iron junk, which would not be
able to drive.
So why are sales executives and business owners still
allow sellers to communicate with customers in the way that occurred to them
seller? After all, the experience accumulated both by one firm and entire industries
gives unambiguous recommendations, which phrases or step-by-step conversation algorithms
give the best result, and which do not give a positive result at all, and
customers simply leave without making a purchase. However, sellers who
fundamentally ignore the scripts of dialogues and negotiations, tend to
contemptuously assert "I'm not a robot!", And again and again step on the same
rake. At the same time, they forget that robots have already replaced workers with automobiles.
conveyors, and with the active development of artificial intelligence will soon
fight for jobs and with sellers.
What are sales scripts, since they are so often argued about? General definition
quite simple and understandable - sales scripts are a set of standard
scenarios of dialogues with potential clients. These scenarios are
sequential speech modules and dialogue templates that are applied on
different stages of the sales funnel or negotiations with the client. Simple, right?
As you can see, there is nothing terrible or reprehensible in using
scripts. On the contrary, knowledge and ability to use such tactics of working with
buyers makes the seller more efficient and more confident - after all, the experience of many other successful colleagues who in similar situations achieved
desired result. In other words, they were selling.
In this chapter, we will give examples of some possible scripts that
are used both in b2b and b2c sales, and effectively show themselves on
various stages of communication with customers. About how you can on your own
prepare sales scripts for your own business, there are many training
books and video tutorials that you can easily find on the Internet. One of the most successful
is a book by business coach Dmitry Tkachenko "Sales scripts", in which
many scripts and speech patterns are provided for numerous examples
successful sales. Some of these examples are used in our Book.
Also one of the possibilities for simple and convenient creation of sales scripts and their
integration with CRM, as the main working tool of the seller, are
specialized software solutions that save ROP time and
sellers. You can find such solutions, including in the Bitrix24 Marketplace, and
they can be installed and added to your Bitrix24.CRM with one click
mouse buttons.
So let's get started?
1. Scripts for establishing contact and detection
customer needs for an incoming call.
Where does every sale start? Of course, from the acquaintance of the seller with
buyer. This acquaintance can occur both at the initiative of the buyer
(who independently applied to the seller's company), and on the initiative
active seller. Of course, in both cases
the actions and reactions of the potential client will be significantly different, and
the sales manager must be prepared for this.
We will consider several basic scripts for establishing contact with
client first with incoming requests (calls or visits of the buyer to the office
or seller's shop). For readability, all speech modules in sales scripts
are in bold - you will immediately see what exactly should be said
seller in any given situation. Highlighted in capital letters
the text will indicate the so-called variable data, which the manager for
fills in sales independently - for example, instead of "NAME manager"
calls his own name, instead of "POSITION TITLE" - director of
marketing, and so on. 1.1. In the event that a potential client independently called your company,
it can get to the secretary, call center operator or directly to the manager
by sales. In those cases when the seller was NOT the first to communicate with the client,
we recommend using a script with switching to a sales manager.
It may consist of the following steps and speech patterns:
Greetings.
Acquaintance with a potential client.
Clarification of the question
Accession and transfer to a sales manager.
This script may consist of the following speech modules:
Greeting: "Hi, this is Company NAME, I'm glad
greet you!" Without pause - transition to Acquaintance.
Acquaintance: “My name is “Employee NAME”. Please tell me how I
can I contact you?" The caller says his name.
 "Clarification of the question": "NAME of the client", glad / glad to have your call. Tell me how
can I help you?" The caller names their question or interest.
If the solution to this issue requires switching to a sales manager -
you need to transfer the call to this specialist. However, it is important to do so
so as not to irritate a potential client who is immediately started
transfer between different employees. Therefore, it is recommended first
use join, and then switch to the manager for
sales. To do this, you can use the following speech template:
"Joining and Transferring a Call": "You've come to the right place! We have this
the issue is dealt with by "NAME SURNAME manager", and right now I can
switch you to him - he will be able to give you accurate information and answer
to all questions. Is it convenient for you to wait 15 seconds while I switch the call?
In most cases, the client will answer “Yes, it’s convenient”, after which you need to
immediately transfer the call to the sales manager.
If the company employs several sales managers, and the operator,
receiving incoming calls, not sure exactly which of them will pick up the phone after
switching, the speech pattern may be somewhat different:
 “You've come to the right place! Our sales department deals with just such
questions, and right now I can switch you to a specialist who can give you accurate information and answer all questions. You are comfortable
wait 15 seconds while I switch the call?".
If your company has already set up a CRM system and telephony is connected to it,
then the operator who received the incoming call may not just switch the call to
manager, but make operational notes (client name and question) to
the manager received a clear incoming lead, and could immediately communicate with the client via
name and with an understanding of his question. If this is not the case, then the operator will have to
communicate information to the manager orally before making the transfer
call to the manager.
It would seem - a very simple script? However, in practice, many secretaries and
sales managers (unless they work in professional call centers,
which now serve most large corporations) manage not to
even stick to it. Therefore, for the head of the sales department or the director
it is very important for a company not only to have incoming call scripts, but also
control their implementation.
1.2. In the event that the client immediately phoned the sales department, or if a
switching the first call of the client to the sales manager should
use the advanced script of the first incoming call. It may consist
of the following steps and speech patterns:
1. Greeting.
2. Acquaintance.
3. Clarification of the question.
4. Joining and identifying needs.
5. An invitation to a meeting or presentation.
Let's look at them in order - in the case when the client immediately
called the sales manager
1. Greeting: "Hi, this is 'COMPANY NAME', you have reached
“DEPARTMENT NAME” (for example, Sales or Customer Service).
Glad to welcome you!
2. “Introduction”: “My name is “NAME SURNAME manager”, I am responsible for working with
clients. Can you tell me how I can contact you?" The client says a name.
“NAME OF THE CLIENT”, nice to meet you – and again, my name is “NAME OF THE MANAGER”.
If the client calls himself by his first name and patronymic, it is advisable to use exactly
the same form of addressing him, and voice his name and patronymic, if the client uses only the name, then the sales manager should only use
name. This module using the repetition of the names of both interlocutors
allows both the manager and the client to remember each other.
3. "Clarification": "I'm glad you called. Tell me how can I help you?"
The client clarifies his question.
4. Joining and identifying needs: "You've come to the right place - our department
is responsible for this question. "CUSTOMER NAME", in order to give you a more accurate
information - let me clarify a few questions, just a couple of minutes.
Would it be convenient for you to answer now?
Next you need:
1. Clarify the basic needs of the client on the issue that he voiced. It may
be questions:
1.1. "Do you choose for yourself?" (when it comes to a product or service for
individual consumer. If the sales manager works in b2b-
industry, the question may sound “Tell me, do you choose for your company?
If it’s not a secret, what is your business profile?”
1.2. “Are you considering only this model / service / product, or want to compare with another
any options?"
1.3. “What are your main requirements for this model/service/product?”
1.4. “How fast do you need to deliver this model/service/product?”
The list of questions can consist of 3-5 questions (think about which questions
the most relevant in your situation), and should be prepared in advance
(it is best if this list is not written by the sales manager himself, but by the ROP). On the
At this stage, it is important to understand the basic needs of the client, which can be solved with
using the product that the company represents. If the sales manager
will skip such a stage, and will immediately start only answering the questions of a potential
client (for example, about the price), then the probability of scheduling a meeting with the client will be
very low.
Of course, the client can call the online store, being ready to buy
- and then a large number of counter questions may surprise him, and in this
if the competence of the call center operator with basic answers to questions can
be enough. However, we encourage you to ask questions here as well.
(such as delivery time or comparison with other models" to translate
client at the stage of payment. This situation is rather applicable only to specific
businesses (online stores or ordering goods / services by phone) - in the rest
cases, the customer and seller will have to go through most of the stages of the funnel
sales.
2. Invite a client to a meeting, for which you can use such speech
modules:
 "Customer NAME" - thank you very much for the detailed information! I see that we
we will definitely be able to help in your question - and I invite you to visit us
office/shop/demo center where I can both show you the options, and
choose the optimal one. It will be convenient for you to come, for example, tomorrow - or
shall we choose another day?
Alternatively, you can invite the client to hold a meeting at his
territory (in the office of his company, for example), if the products or services of the seller
can be demonstrated at a road show (live or with the help of
electronic presentation). This option is often used by b2b managers-
sales - and for this you will need to apply the following speech template:
 "Customer NAME" - thank you very much for the detailed information! I see that we
we will definitely be able to help you with your issue - and we are ready to come to your office to
show you the options and help you choose the best one. you
Are you in the NAME OF THE CITY? Great - how are your schedules, let's say
tomorrow afternoon? Fits? Then I write down the address - and I will be with you
tomorrow at 3:00 pm, okay?”
If a meeting with the client is not possible due to the fact that the seller and the client
located in different cities (and the seller does not have any physical
representative office at the customer's location), you can offer the customer
communication by phone or on the Internet (via Skype, Viber or using another
conference messenger.
"Customer NAME" - thank you very much for the detailed information! I see that we
we can definitely help in your question - and please give me one day to
preparing the best offer for you. Please contact me tomorrow
on Skype and I can give you a personal presentation on
the product/service/model you are interested in. Are you using Skype?
If the client does not use Skype or other digital communication channels -
you should invite him to make a phone call using the following
speech pattern:
 "NAME of the client", I understand - then let's talk on the phone. On what
It will be more convenient for you to communicate with the number - am I ready to record? For clients from
Russian Federation, you can start calling the first digits of the number (“I
ready to record - eight nine hundred ...") - this increases the likelihood that
the potential client will automatically dictate their number.
If the customer number is known in advance (your company uses a PBX with
or IP-telephony), the sales manager can simply
ask again:
 "If I'm not mistaken, is your number 'Customer Phone Number'?" You are comfortable
What happens if I call back tomorrow at "EXACT time"?
The main task of the sales manager at this stage of communication with the client is
get exact contact details from him, and set the exact time of the future
communication with the client.
And now - let's once again conclude why and for what we need such
scripts for an incoming call from a potential buyer. For he may be
take and immediately buy? Ah, if only business were that easy…. On the very
In fact, the consumer or customer ALWAYS has a choice - and this gives him the opportunity
call several suppliers to decide who he will buy from.
Those inept or lazy salespeople who will simply “let go” of the client for everything
four parties, without showing any initiative to establish more
strong contact, holding a meeting or presentation, risk communicating with this
man for the last time - unlike their more "toothy" competitors. On the
practice of a very large number of sales managers who accept
phone calls, waiting and hoping that the client will do everything for them, and he will not
will have to convince or make special effort - and this is very far from the harsh
reality, in which it is necessary and important to work with the buyer, to identify him
needs, present and sell. Scripts from the first paragraph of this chapter
will help you make this process controllable, and correctly start a dialogue with
client with specific goals.
2. Scripts for establishing contact, identifying decision makers and
identifying the needs of the client when making an outgoing call.
In order for customers to call you on their own, you must either be very
well-known company, or constantly invest in high-quality advertising,
designed to attract customers. Business owners do not always have
enough time to accumulate respect and market recognition, or
there are enough funds that could be invested in active marketing. On the
assistance to owners and their sellers comes active sales - which
usually begin with a phone call to a potential client.
We will consider the scripts that are the most difficult for the seller
situations - namely "cold calls". In these cases, the seller calls
a company in which neither the decision maker (decision maker - for example,
head of marketing department or head of purchasing department, or even director),
nor his exact phone number. As a rule, such techniques are used in b2b-
sales.
So, we are considering the option of "cold call". In this case, the seller must:
A. Identify the decision maker.
B. Perform a "blocker bypass" - the so-called secretaries or operators, one of
whose tasks are to cut off potential sellers on the way to their
direct or indirect managers.
C. Get to know the decision maker and arrange a meeting with him.
In order to succeed with this script, the sales manager
must:
 Know the scope or area of ​​responsibility of your potential
interlocutor - for example, your company's customers are most often
HR directors, or heads of the marketing department. Therefore, when
the first call you need to find out who is directly responsible for this
direction in the company.
 Be prepared that he will not be immediately switched to the right interlocutor, but
will be asked to leave contacts, or send information by e-mail
mail/fax. In more than 90 percent of such cases, history will not receive
no continuation - no one will just read sales letters,
received at the general address of the secretary. Therefore, the task of the manager is any
the price to achieve switching to the decision maker.
 Under no circumstances should you tell the secretary or operator that
the call is related to sales or the sales manager is calling - probability
the fact that the conversation will not go anywhere else will be even higher than 90 percent.
This topic should be raised only when communicating with decision makers.
 Own several speech modules that will help in the implementation
planned scenario. In this case, we suggest using (on
choice of your company) various options for speech patterns:
2.1. Sales manager: "Good afternoon, please connect me with
“JOB NAME” - is he in place?
If the secretary asks "What are you calling about?" or “Who asks?”
You can use the following speech modules:
 Sales manager, "This is the 'NAME SURNAME manager', I need to
convey information." If the secretary asks again what the question is or
information, you can say “On the issue of interaction between departments
our companies. Please switch."
 Sales manager: "This is the 'NAME SURNAME manager' from the 'NAME
company", I was asked to give your "JOB TITLE"
address invitation, and you need to clarify the details of his schedule.
Please switch."
In this situation, the sales manager does not specify the name and surname of the decision maker, but immediately
is trying to organize a switch to the representative of the company he needs -
potential client.
2.2. Sales Manager:
 “Hi, this is Company NAME. We received a call from
firms on the question "DIRECTION of activity of a potential decision maker" - but
I was not given the name of the caller. Tell me - who could it be?
In this situation, the manager can find out both the last name and first name of the potential decision maker,
and his exact job title. If the secretary answers the question,
develop the speech script in this way:
 "Great! Thank you very much! Let me write down the exact name of it
position - dictate? And what's his name again? Recorded, thanks! But as
me to talk to him - you can switch, or you need to dial him on
any specific number?
If the secretary does not give any information, then you can use the following
speech pattern:
 “That's bad luck! I was not there at that moment, and the question “DIRECTION
activities of a potential decision maker” is in the area of ​​my competence.
Probably, it is necessary with "TITLE OF THE POSITION OF A POTENTIAL DECISION"
chat - tell me, what is his name? The more often the sales manager will use different
professional terminology in a conversation with a secretary, the higher his chances
get the contacts of the desired decision maker and ensure the call is switched.
2.3. Sales manager: "Good afternoon, and I'm in" DEPARTMENT NAME
potential decision maker" hit? And switch to them please!”
If the secretary does not want to switch, and begins to find out the details of who is calling
and for which question, the sales manager can answer:
 “My name is “NAME SURNAME manager”, and within the scope of my competence
includes interaction with departments "NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT of the potential
LPR" of companies like yours. Switch to them, please!
If the secretary continues to clarify information, the sales manager can
reply:
 "Let's repeat it again - "NAME SURNAME manager" from the company
"COMPANY NAME", we are with your department "DEPARTMENT NAME"
we are planning a joint project. If your internal
switching calls - can you tell me their direct number, I'll dial?
Of course, you may come across a fairly professional secretary,
who received the installation from his supervisor (or developed it
on your own) - do not switch anyone, except for familiar companies or
relatives, and in no case connect it with potential sellers.
For such cases, there are also several speech patterns that help everyone
to achieve the planned result and get a connection or a direct
LPR number.
We will consider the following situations:
1. The secretary says "We don't need anything."
 Sales manager: “That's why I want to talk to “TITLE
POSITIONS”, because our question is of a rather narrow profile, and it
knows if he needs it or not. Switch, please!
 Sales Manager: “It is unlikely that there is such a specialist who
refuse an important and profitable offer without even reading it. I think that your "JOB TITLE" is not like that? Connect with him
please".
 Sales manager: “I understand that my question may not be needed
to you personally, but your "JOB TITLE" will surely be upset if
will not receive the necessary information in time. Switch, please!
 Sales Manager: "I'm sure your 'JOB TITLE'
always chooses the best - and what should he do if he does not know about our
opportunities? Connect with him, please."
 Sales manager: “I sometimes get this response, but my appetite
comes with meals. Clients who did not immediately start communicating now
very satisfied with the cooperation with us, and I am sure that this is just such
happening. Switch to "JOB TITLE", please!"
2. The secretary says "Submit your proposal by email
/fax/tell me - I will pass it on. ”
 Sales manager: “The proposal itself will not be able to answer the questions
your "JOB TITLE", but I can. Three minutes of conversation will be here
more useful than a ten page letter. Switch, please!".
 Sales manager: “In my experience, most executives
they prefer to set the task correctly for their partners first, and then
already check the offer. This probably applies to yours as well.
"JOB TITLE". Switch to it, please!"
 Sales manager: “So I just need to talk to
"JOB TITLE" to clarify the details, and after that I can already
prepare more accurate information for him. Connect, please!
 Sales manager: “Of course, I will send an offer when your
"JOB TITLE" will say - yes, we are interested. Otherwise, themselves
you know, there is enough spam on the computer without me. In three minutes of conversation we
we will agree on all the issues for the proposal with him - please connect!
So let's imagine that the sales manager managed to bypass the secretary,
and he was switched to the necessary interlocutor. Persistence and application
effective speech modules helped - but, most likely, the seller does not know yet
the exact name of the LPR. In this situation, you need to use the following script:
1. Acquaintance with decision makers.
2. Brief description of the purpose of the call.
Engage in dialogue.
4. Proposal for a meeting.
5. Overcoming objections.
6. Coordination of results and agreement on a meeting.
The scenario of a conversation with a decision maker will be longer than with a secretary - and, of course,
the same, more complicated, as a more professional will communicate with the seller
specialist. Therefore, it is very important to find the right arguments for such
a person in order to interest him and encourage him to action (which, as a rule,
is a meeting). The sales manager can use in this script
the following speech modules:
 Acquaintance with decision makers. “Good afternoon, my name is “NAME SURNAME”, company
"COMPANY NAME", and I asked to be connected to "NAME
POSITIONS OF THE LPR" - I hope I got to you?"
if the interlocutor says that they switched incorrectly, or says that such
they do not have a position in the company, you should use the following speech module:
 “Yes, apparently the secretary made a mistake. Tell me, a then your company is responsible
for the "LINE OF ACTIVITY OF THE LPR"? Let me write down - what is his name?
Thank you - and how can I contact him - maybe you can switch?
As a result, the sales manager can get the exact contact (name,
position and even a direct phone number) of the decision maker he needs.
If the interlocutor does not admit that it is he, but immediately begins to clarify “And why
question are you calling?", you can use the following speech pattern.
 “I want to discuss cooperation in the field of “ACTIVITY
LPR”, this issue is within the scope of my competence. But I'm embarrassed
because I don’t know your name – tell me how to address you?”.
With a high probability, the decision maker will name his name.
 “Excellent, “NAME OF THE LPR”, and I remind you again, my name is “NAME OF THE MANAGER”. So
how do you manage the "NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT", you probably have an interest
to “THE BENEFITS FROM COOPERATION WITH
MANAGER - is that right? That's why I'm calling you!"
Thus, we have already moved to the second stage of the script of such a cold call -
began to describe the purpose of their call, and even partially on the third - they began to involve
decision makers in the process of dialogue. But not always at the other end of the telephone wire you will immediately be asked about the purpose of the call - therefore, the sales manager must be ready and
other speech patterns. For example, these:
 Sales Manager: “That's why I'm calling you, LPR NAME. you answer
for the "LINE OF ACTIVITY OF THE DMP" (for example, for marketing), and we -
a company that provides "PRODUCT NAME OR SERVICE" as
times for "NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DECISION" (for example, for marketing departments). What kind
What are the first steps we need to take to start cooperation?” At
using such a template, the seller immediately skillfully translates the dialogue into
cooperation plane, while enabling potential
give the buyer a "hint" - in which direction to follow
build this conversation.
 Sales Manager: "NAME OF THE LPR", So that I can immediately start from the very
important, tell me what interest you see in “collaboration with new
suppliers / new solutions in the field of Internet marketing /
automation of marketing processes / etc.”? When using such
template can be easily obtained from a potential client
fast feedback, but you need to be well prepared for accurate
the formulation of the products or services that the company provides
manager, which would immediately display some benefit for
prospective customer.
 Sales Manager: "NAME OF THE LPR", tell me - your company is now
uses "the scope of the product or service that the
manager - for example, CRM systems, or fuel briquettes, or
corporate training in foreign languages? Great - that's why I
I'm calling you!" Whatever response the manager receives, positive or
negative, he will always be able to carry on the conversation further, and develop it in
side of the benefits of cooperation on a topic already known to the buyer when answering
"Yes" or towards the prospects of using this product or service.
As in the case of an incoming call, the ideal outcome of the first conversation
the seller with the decision maker can be considered an appointment. However, it is not possible to agree on
will always be simple - as a rule, a potential client will always have
many excuses or objections not to meet. To enrich this
script, we propose the use of some effective speech modules,
which are often used in their practice by well-known business coaches on
sales (Dmitry Tkachenko, Sergey Azimov, and others):
2. The decision maker says "we are not interested."
Sales manager: "NAME OF THE LPR", it is possible that you are right. To make it
to find out for sure, it will take a maximum of 15 minutes. What time will you
most convenient for the meeting - at the end of this week or at the beginning
next?"
 Sales manager: “IMYA LPR”, two weeks ago I called one of
companies in your industry, and its director also first said that they
service is not needed. However, we still agreed to meet, and in
As a result, he saw a clear benefit for their firm, and we began to work.
Let's meet - I'm sure it will benefit you! What time do you
will be the most convenient for the meeting - at the end of this week or at the beginning
next?"
 Sales manager: "NAME OF THE DOCTOR", I often hear this phrase - and I understand
you, because you have been on the market for many years. More than half of our clients from this and
started communication - but without the new there is no development, right? let's
We will meet at the most convenient time for you - at the end of this week
Or at the beginning of the next?
 Sales manager: "NAME OF THE DM", it would be strange to assume that you
immediately show interest in services/products that you don't know much about
information. After you know all the details of our offer,
the benefits will become more obvious - and it only takes me 15 minutes to do this. Can
meet the day after tomorrow or at the beginning of next week - when you
more convenient?"
Sales Manager: "NAME OF THE LPR", tell me - and on what conditions will you
Interested in cooperation with our company? let's discuss
this question at the meeting - when is it more convenient for you?
2. The decision maker says “I don’t have time for a meeting” or “Chat with my
subordinate."
 Sales manager: "NAME OF THE LPR", I understand you - for sure, you get
many suggestions. I know how much time to spend on
study and analysis, so I offer you a meeting for just 15 minutes (instead of
hours to study a pile of papers), after which I will make a targeted offer
just one A4 sheet. When is the best time for me to visit you?"
 Sales manager: "IMYA LPR" - it's a pleasure to deal with a professional,
treasure every minute! I appreciate your time - and therefore I promise with
maximum benefit for you to use 15 minutes at your convenience
time. When would be the best time to go?"
 Sales manager: "NAME LPR" - of course, I can tell everything to your
subordinates, but only the manager will be able to evaluate some details of our proposal. In addition, we can avoid the spoiled
phone, meeting in person – when is it more convenient for you?”
3. The decision maker says: “We already have suppliers!”.
 Sales manager": "DM NAME" - I know that the supplier is the one who
offers the most favorable conditions. Let's compare and you decide with whom
it's better to work!"
 Sales manager: "IMYA LPR", a proven supplier - it is always
ok, I agree. But having a choice is also good,
is it true? Let's meet and you can compare working conditions and make
a more balanced choice - when is it more convenient for you?
 Sales manager: “NAME OF THE DMP”, so I don’t offer you
abandon the current supplier. But it's always better to have a spare
one more suggestion - it may come in handy in case of force majeure, and
even just for comparison, right? Let's meet and at least you
get an opportunity for safety net – when is it more convenient for you?”
 Sales Manager: “NAME OF THE DOCTOR, tell me - and you are one hundred percent
satisfied with the cooperation with suppliers in this area, or how
usually? What would you like to improve in their work? High
probability that any client will find reasons for any
dissatisfaction or fair criticism of existing
suppliers, and the sales manager can listen to them and then say:
“Thank you for sharing this, LPR NAME! I propose to meet
I will tell you how we usually make sure that our customers are not
dissatisfied in such situations. When is it more convenient for you?
 Sales manager: “NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT MAN”, so does this interfere with working with us?”
The logical outcome of such telephone conversations should be an appointed
meeting with a client. Summing up the agreements reached during the conversation
You can use the following speech module:
 Sales manager: "IMYA LPR", thank you for the productive communication!
Tomorrow (the day after tomorrow, at another appointed time) I will be in your office -
let's exchange mobile numbers just in case, ready
write down! Excellent, thank you - let me dial you right now so that you
wrote down my number.
Two factors that will help the seller still make an appointment with the decision maker -
self-confidence and perseverance. Using ready-made (and tested by many other sales managers) speech templates and sales scripts
will help how to provide a higher confidence of the manager in himself, the product,
which he represents, and the company in which he works, so be more
persistent, step by step managing the beginning of the sales process.
But what to do if there is not a cold, but a “warm call” - the seller calls
already known to him by the decision maker, by a known phone number, and a topic known to both
for a conversation? This could be a call to an incoming lead (this situation applies
both for b2b and b2c sales).
Most likely, the sales manager in this situation will feel
better, since it will get rid of the need to bypass the secretary, and it will be easier for him
start a dialogue with the client. During this conversation, you can use
the following speech modules:
 Sales manager: “DM NAME”, this is the “Manager NAME” from the company
"Company name". That's why I'm calling you - you were interested
“NAME of the service/product”, right? Let me describe to you in more detail what we
we can offer you - and you will say whether this option is suitable, or you need
something else, okay?"
 Sales manager: “DM NAME”, this is “Manager NAME” from “TITLE
company” – do you remember, we already communicated with you? I have prepared for you
information about what you may be interested in - give me now 60
seconds?"
 Sales manager: “DM NAME”, this is “Manager NAME” from “TITLE
companies." I know that you are interested in "NAME of the service / product) - and I want to
tell you how we can help you make the best choice, and
compare with other offers. Give me one minute?"
The purpose of such a call will be a brief presentation already theoretically
interested client for the purpose of further your appointment appointment (or
instant execution of the sale / payment / execution of the contract, if this
standard transactional sales, and the client will have enough communication
phone to make a purchasing decision). However, it is likely that even this
case, the sales manager will have to face certain
objections or excuses of a potential client - and here they can also
prove useful are the speech modules that we cited above for cold
call. In addition, below we provide additional modules to overcome
various customer objections that arise already at the stage of the meeting,
presentations, negotiations, and also give our readers a worksheet for
compiling your own speech modules for working with objections.
Speech modules for working with objections.
So what are the most popular objections you and your salespeople face in
your job?
“Are you expensive?”, “We don’t have time for this now!”, “Now is the crisis!”?
Do you know what often happens when a sales manager hears an objection from
client. He…gives up. In the head of the manager at this moment, the thoughts “This is not
my client”, “Well, he doesn’t want to buy, and he doesn’t need to”, “It’s expensive for this - we’ll find another,
which will be inexpensive! But in fact, the existence of an objection is not at all
means that the client does not want or is not ready to buy - on the contrary, he demonstrates
readiness for the negotiation process, which the seller is simply obliged to
use. And you can do this with the help of the desire to sell and the skills to
dealing with customer objections.
Let's explore different tactics for overcoming objections using the example of
popular (at least that's what sellers think) objection - "You have
expensive".
1. Tactics "And if we see?".
If the client expresses certain doubts about the appropriateness
purchases of your products or services due to "high cost", it is necessary
rephrase his objection using the following speech module:
The client says - "You are expensive!".
 Sales Manager: "CUSTOMER NAME", and if we see that the purchase of our
services will not only allow you to get "describe the first significant
advantage - for example - quality and reliability", but also allows you to
“We describe the second significant advantage - for example, savings in the future
on the service”, would you be interested in cooperating with us?
If the client answers “no”, then it’s not about the first objection (Expensive!)
still not convinced of the key arguments of your proposal, and you need to conduct
work to strengthen these arguments. If the client expresses interest,
then you need to develop the idea further and justify the cost of your proposal
the quality of its components.
2. Tactics "We will not advise bad."
The client says: "It's expensive for you!"
 Sales manager: “Of course, good products/services are expensive –
I wouldn't give you bad advice! Yes, and you would hardly agree to a cheap low-quality offer - you choose for yourself,
right?".
Such a speech module easily translates the dialogue into a discussion of value
your product/service, not its price.
3. Tactics "Only the price."
If the client uses the usual objection “Your prices are expensive!” or “Give me a discount!”
then you can also use the proven speech module:
Sales manager: "Customer's name", tell me - but you are only interested in the price,
or are “reliability, quality, timing, quality assurance, support –
use your arguments here"? Because if only cost is important, then we
we can recommend you a young company, which was made by acquaintances
students, and they do very inexpensively. Of course, about “guarantees, support and
reliability” is out of the question here - however, I think this option is not very good for you either -
will it fit?"
4. Tactics "Customers often ask."
The client says - "You are expensive!".
 Sales Manager: "Customer NAME", you know, our customers often
they ask before buying - why are you so expensive? What do you think I am
answer?"
If the client begins to list the benefits of your offer
(for example - probably because you have a lot of experience, or you are reliable), you need
help him develop the thought using an additional argument: “Of course,
this is what is important for our customers, and besides, here's something else (specify
extra argument). That is why clients choose us.
If the client says they don't know, or criticizes (probably you are doing a big
margin) - you yourself need to list 3-4 key arguments in favor of a high
the quality and competence of your proposal.
5. Tactics "Unpleasant conversation."
The client says "Your prices are high!" or “Give me a discount!”. Sales Manager: "Customer NAME" - I understand your desire
save. But as a professional, I'm sure it's better to have
unpleasant (or difficult) conversation about the price than to blush for a long time later
quality. Speaking of quality, that is the value of our offer……”Sales Manager: "CUSTOMER NAME", I understand what you would like
save. I recently read the famous expression that joy comes from
a low price lasts much shorter than the disappointment of low quality
Do you think you agree with him? So, speaking of quality - that's what
the value of our offer…..”
6. Tactics "Customers know".
The client says "Your prices are high!"
 Sales Manager: "Customer NAME", what do you think - our current
Do customers know that you can find cheaper offers on the market? Of course
know - now everyone monitors the market! And why do you think that
do they still buy from us?
7. Accession tactics.
This is a fairly popular technique for effectively overcoming the most
various objections. It consists of the following steps:
1. Active listening - listen to the whole client without interrupting.
2. Joining - show the client that his opinion is important to you, that you are on
one side with him.
3. Question - show the client that you are really interested in his position, and
you want to understand it better.
4. Overcoming, which also ends with a question - you help the client
deal with obstacles on the way to your deal, and manage
negotiations further, asking the client a question that at the same time
reinforce the objection.
When overcoming an objection, it is especially important to call the client by name (or
name to patronymic, if he prefers this style of address).
Here is what the standard overcoming of the objection we are discussing “You have
expensive!"
Sales manager: "Customer's name", I understand you well - I myself always
I carefully consider everything before buying. How much do you think the cost
product depends on its quality?
The client answers, gives some of his assumptions.
Sales manager: "Of course - usually the cheapest is what is done poorly,
poor quality. You do not need a Chinese fake, but a good and reliable product,
right?".
Of course, in your case, specific objections can be much
more - we have given in the table only examples with the most common ones.
We recommend that you use a similar spreadsheet in your sales department by doing
its available to all sales managers, and practicing overcoming such
objections literally every day. This can be done in the morning operating rooms
department meetings, during lunch breaks, at specially selected
throughout the day ten minutes of professional development. When sellers can
use speech modules to overcome common objections in
automatic mode - the efficiency of their sales will increase significantly!</p>
