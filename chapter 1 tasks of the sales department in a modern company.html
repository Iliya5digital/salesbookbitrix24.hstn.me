So, dear readers, let's talk about the sales department. Why do you need him
needed? What is sales anyway?
Let's imagine a company that produces unprecedented beauty and
attractiveness of products. The rumor about such a miracle company will
spread, customers will knock on the door of the office (or store) of this
firms, cut off all phones, ask them to take their money as soon as possible ...
Sounds like a fairy tale. In real life, everything is different: customers have to
look for them, you need to call them yourself. Yes, and those buyers who themselves come, too

sales.
The business process for which you need to create such a department is to attract
new customers to the company for the purpose of selling the company's goods or services, and
serving existing customers in order to continue cooperation with
them and getting new orders.
The seller must sell. It makes sense and seems to be the only correct one.
conclusion. However, in practice, there are often examples when sellers
simultaneously perform the tasks of marketers, accountants, service engineers,
loaders, dispatchers and many many other useful professions and
specialties. Therefore, in many companies, the sales department as such is either not
exists, and its sales function is blurred between numerous divisions, or, conversely, includes a large number of
employees who are not directly involved in the sales process.
Depending on the market in which your company operates - B2B (business to
business) when the sale takes place between different legal entities or
businesses, or B2C (business to consumer), when a company sells something
individual consumers), the specifics of sales, of course, will differ.
However, the business process itself will remain unchanged: communication work with
by the client in order to meet his specific needs,

customer to the supplier's products, and the seller is the person who either
acts as the initiator of this exchange, or controls it from the moment
first contact with a potential client.
To make it easy for you to check the performance of your company (how well
your employees manage this process), at the end of the first chapter we
Here is a checklist (questionnaire) for an effective sales department. One of the important questions
in this questionnaire it will be about whether the employees of the sales department are engaged in
only work that involves a process of dialogues and negotiations with
client, ending with the transfer of the client's money to your account
enterprises, or do they have to be both Swiss, and reapers, and players on the pipe?
Let's take a look at what sales people should be doing.
Specifics of sales in b2b and b2c
For example, in most b2b companies, sales staff must
be responsible for the following processes:
1. Attracting new customers. This process includes active work
filling the company's client base:
• work with incoming leads (requests, requests, calls);
• work with potential clients from the existing client base (with
using the same calls, personal meetings or correspondence in digital
communication channels);
• work to replenish the client base with live contacts on various
marketing activities in which the company takes part:
exhibitions, seminars, conferences and so on.
The task of the seller here is simple and clear: he needs to start the sales process
to a potential client of the company who either made a request
independently, or his interest began to form (through active
outgoing communication) the seller himself. But not only start, the sale process
must be brought to its logical conclusion:
• registration of the purchase;
• approval of the transaction;
• signing the contract;
• transfer of money to the account of the enterprise whose interests are represented
salesman.
2. Repeat sales to existing customers of the company
This process will be partially different from the previous one, since the seller is often
no longer have to look for customers or wait for them to contact him
independently (although this can also happen). In the customer base of the seller
there will be a formed pool of clients who have already at least once (and possibly even
many times) ordered and paid for the products or services of the enterprise, in
which the seller works. Knowing the frequency of demand for these products,
the seller can independently initiate new transactions with such a valid client, and may receive new requests from such customers, process them
and sell. The key difference from the first point will be that
between the company and the customer there is already a certain history of relationships,
which allows you to build more efficient work with it.
Interestingly, in b2c sales processes will be almost identical, but in
many areas of activity (for example, in retail or consumer
services) merchants will often not distinguish between new and existing customers and will
build the process of working with them in exactly the same way (as if at the first
acquaintance). About what tools help sellers from any field
activities, we will talk later, but now we will do one very important
conclusion.
Sales is a business process, and any business process needs to be managed.
It is for this reason that salespeople in many companies are called managers.
in sales, because the original meaning of the word "manager" is a manager. AT
We will also use the term “manager of operations” throughout this book.

Sales Manager. The sales department consists of sales managers,
working under the direct supervision of the head of the sales department. O
the role of the head of sales (often use the abbreviation ROP) we will say
in the same chapter of the Book, when we examine the functional responsibilities of employees
sales team, now let's take a look at the different roles they can
play.
Types of sales
In order to represent the universal structure of the sales department, it is necessary
define several criteria that characterize the business
directly to your company. Depending on the specifics of the sale
can be:
1. Direct, which are directly dealt with by sales managers,
or indirect, when sales are carried out by partners, agents, dealers or
resellers of your company, and sales managers to a greater extent
control their activities and act as a link between such
intermediaries, the company itself and end customers, if necessary.
2. Active, when the work of sales managers is built on active
outgoing contacts with customers, including the so-called "cold
calls", and passive, when customers independently contact
sales managers or to the company as a whole with a formed
request for a specific product or service. In the second case, the manager's job
on sales may seem not so much a sale as a shipment already
buyer ready to order. However, in practice, not everything is so simple, oh
than we shall speak in other chapters of this Book.
3. Transactional, consulting and project (or
strategic).
• In the first case, we are talking about sales of already fully finished products or
services, the buyer only has to choose one of several offered
options, and the seller - to accept payment (transaction) from the client. This type
sales does not require the active influence of the sales manager on the position
customer (as an example, let's take a typical trip to the store).
Consultative selling involves a more active dialogue with the client
in order to identify its needs and form a commercial
proposals based on specific perceived needs and requirements of the client
(An example would be a visit by a patient to a clinic where
on the basis of research and diagnosis, the patient is prescribed
a complex of treatment, without trying to feed your
client with tablets).
• Strategic or project sales involve involvement in the process
sales of a large number of specialists from various other
divisions of the company or even connecting other firms to the transaction
(competitors or partners), taking into account high professional
requirements of a potential client that cannot be met
resources exclusively of the sales manager or his company (in
As an example, consider the construction of a new stadium in a major
city, impossible without the participation of a large number of specialists and
contractors).
4. New and repeated (or regular). We talked about these types of sales
a little higher: new sales are made to customers who previously had nothing
bought from this company, and repeated or regular - to buyers, from
who already have a history of completed orders from the company in which they work
Sales Manager.
Specialization in the sales department
Depending on what types of sales are used in your company, you can
draw a conclusion about the requirements for the specialization of sales managers within
sales department. Specialization is the assignment to individual managers of
sales of specific functions corresponding to a certain type of sales.
For example, the sales department of a company that has both direct and indirect
sales may include:
1. Head of sales department.
2. Direct sales managers.
3. Managers for work with partners (implemented by influencing the function of indirect
sales).
The sales department of a company that has active and passive sales can
to consist of:
Head of Sales Department.
2. Active sales managers (who work with the help of
telemarketing, or active outgoing phone calls).
3. Managers for processing incoming calls.
You may be asking why not combine these two functions as part of the work
one manager who can both receive calls and make calls
on one's own? The answer is very simple: imagine a situation in which
a potential client who called the company does not receive due attention from
interlocutor (sales manager), because at that moment he with all his thoughts
busy scheduling future outgoing calls. Or, which is also bad, the manager
in sales stops calling other customers altogether, because he is worried,
that will miss some incoming requests. In practice, this often happens
often when a company has many potential customers (we are not talking about dozens, but
about hundreds or thousands of possible customers). In this case, clearly
it is recommended that sales managers specialize in the functions of active and
passive sales.
A similar specialization can be introduced under the condition of combining in
companies of various types of sales (transactional, consulting,
strategic), moreover, in this case, the company with a high probability
several sales departments will work, in one of which managers for
sales will be occupied solely by simple customer service
(transactional sales), and within another department can create
consulting and strategic deals (sales managers in data
departments, of course, should have a higher level of qualification not
only in the field of sales, but also those specialized markets in which
business and its potential customers).
Specialization of the sales department for managers to attract new customers and
managers to support and retain existing customers
often used with a large volume of new and repeat sales when it comes to
about a large number of clients, for example, more than several hundred client
calls or transactions per month per sales manager. If a
your company has so many clients, it is better to single out individual managers,
who will work only with new customers, as well as those who will
provide quality service to existing (permanent) customers.
If the company serves a limited number of customers, or the entire
the market in which the company operates has up to one hundred customers, introduction
specialization on the function of new and repeat sales would be redundant.
Summing up. You and I can see that it is possible to consolidate within the sales department
for individual managers of specific specific sales functions. However
this is not the only option for the distribution of various responsibilities between
sales managers within the department. It is also possible to specialize
sales managers for:
1. Geographical identification of the client base, when for individual managers
all clients from a particular region of the country or individual
countries.
2. Product categories, when the distribution of responsibility within the department
sales can also occur according to the product range
or the services they sell.
3. Type of customers when different sales managers can lead
exceptionally large clients (usually they are called players of the level
Enterprise, large corporations, holding companies, trading houses, etc.), or customers from
SMB categories (small and medium businesses. In part, such specialization can
intersect with the sales function according to the model of transactional, consulting
or strategic sales (for example, large corporate customers often
make purchases through tenders or lengthy approval procedures and to
they need a special approach of experienced managers, while small
private entrepreneurs may well make purchases corresponding to
rather than transactional or consulting sales).
Head of Sales Department (ROP)
At the head of the process of formation and distribution of areas of responsibility between
various managers of the sales department should, of course, be the head
sales department. His role is to perform the key functions of the manager
individual transactions, but the entire sales process. Here are four main responsibilities
head of sales department:
1. Planning the company's sales.
2. Delegation of tasks related to sales business processes to various
sales managers.
3. Motivating sales staff (including how to use
the system of remuneration and motivation of sellers approved in the company,
and direct participation in raising the team and fighting spirit
sales managers).
Control over the work of the sales department and its employees, analysis of performance
(or non-fulfillment) of the plans and tasks assigned to the department, and
process improvement initiatives resulting from this review
(actually - who rotation to the planning stage).
The head of the sales department does not have to have individual
tasks and plans for sales, since its main mission is precisely to
managing processes and people who sell. Therefore, the head of the department
sales does not always have to be a great seller (although this is how
usually welcome), but he definitely needs to be a strong administrator.
ROP (abbreviation for Head of Sales) manages
processes, analyzes quantitative and financial results and already in
the second queue connects personally to specific transactions and negotiations (as
a rule when it comes to large and complex clients, where the expertise of one
a sales manager may not be enough).
Another function that the ROP can perform is the system administrator.
CRM. In large companies, it is easier to allocate an individual employee for this, but in
In small and medium-sized businesses, the sales department often consists of just
several people, and each additional employee in the department carries a tangible
financial burden for the company. And the tasks to be performed
CRM administrator (this is not a technical specialist who monitors
performance of the program itself), require just a high level
competence of the employee managing the sales process. To
it was easier to understand the specifics of this position, we present the main
functional responsibilities of a sales manager, head of department
sales and CRM administrator.
Responsibilities of the Sales Manager, Head of Sales and
CRM administrator:
1. Functional responsibilities of a sales manager:
• Carry out work to sell the company's products and services to customers.
• Search for new clients.
• Advise clients on any incoming requests, switching them
if necessary, to other departments to provide more accurate
consultations.
Fill out customer cards in CRM according to the established rules.
• Control timely payment by customers for goods and services
companies. conduct work aimed at paying off accounts receivable
debt.
• Encourage customers to make repeat orders.
• Compile and submit reports established by the company to the head of the department
sales at the specified time.
2. Functional responsibilities of the head of the sales department:
• Carry out work for the management of the sales department, including planning
activities and results of the department, delegation of tasks to employees
department, motivational initiatives and performance analysis and control
activities of the sales department.
• Initiate, coordinate and control the launch of projects and work
initiatives within the sales department aimed at business development
companies, increasing the customer base and increasing the profitability of the work
sales department and the company as a whole.
• Control the operational work of the department's employees, their performance
job descriptions and functional responsibilities.
• Conduct regular events of the sales department (meetings, planning meetings).
• Train and mentor the staff of the department, promote their growth
professional qualifications.
• Help department staff solve any non-standard and complex
situations in relations with the company's customers or employees
other departments.
• Monitor the active and efficient work of department employees in CRM,
provide employees with timely and accurate feedback
about the quality of their work with the client base and CRM.
• Timely submit requests to the HR department for finding new
employees to the sales department, in accordance with the company's
recruitment rules.
3. Functional responsibilities of the CRM administrator:
Quality control over the development of all sales and correctness
prioritization by sales staff (for example,
the number of cases completed and not completed on time, tasks for working with
key customers and transactions, successful completion of transactions by stages
sales and the absence of transactions that do not move along the sales funnel).
• Quality control over the development of all key counterparties.
• Monitoring the high performance of sales staff
(the predominance of effective actions over ordinary actions).
• Regular quality control of effective actions of department employees
sales (for example, listening to telephone conversations with key
clients, analysis of client cards and history of relationships with them).
• Organization of effective work of sales staff with CRM-
system. Including:
• Control over the effective processing of leads.
• Control over the quality filling of CRM sales department employees
systems.
• CRM system management.
Regular preparation and submission of sales reports to the manager
sales department and company management.
As you can see, the main job and functional responsibilities of the head
the sales department and the CRM administrator partially overlap, so in
small companies (or even large firms that do not need to
create a large sales force) this role can be filled by the same person.
At the same time, the differences between the responsibilities of the seller (who works in
first of all with clients, contracts and payments) and
manager/administrator (who works with sellers, client base
and CRM) are very essential, so you should never combine these responsibilities.
But what if the sales department does not have a manager? The truth is simple. In this
situation, either the director of the company will be forced to manage the sales process,
or its owner. Sales is too important for a company to
leave it without the proper level of control and management. Is it just necessary
spend valuable time of the owner of the company (or its director) on things that can
do a person who specializes specifically in sales management? We
we still recommend that you consider the work of the sales department under the management
dedicated department head.
Checklist for an effective sales force
To make it easier for you to understand how effectively the department is working
sales in your company, we have prepared a special questionnaire (checklist), which
you can fill in by yourself.
You can evaluate each of the items of the questionnaire on a five-point system (where the score
1 (one) would mean that the answer to this question is rather sharply negative (in
your sales department does not have this feature or does not work, and the rating is 5 (five)
will indicate that this function is implemented in your sales department and
works as efficiently as possible). There are 20 questions in the questionnaire. In this way,
The maximum result of the survey will be 100 points or 100
percent that your sales force is built and operates the most
efficient way for modern business. Minimum result (20
points) will mean that your sales team is operating at a fairly low
level of efficiency and should be reorganized and changed as soon as possible
