will unlock the use of CRM for your sales team.
What is CRM and why is it so important?
In order to avoid confusion, we will immediately define the terms. What
CRM? The standard definition (Customer Relationship Management) says in
first of all, not about a software product, but about a system of relationships with
customers in general. Wikipedia describes CRM as an interaction model
business with the client, and the main activities of the company are
measures to ensure effective marketing, sales and customer service.
What is the difference between this model and the CRM system? The CRM system is already understood
not a concept, but a corporate information (or software) environment, in
which is customer relationship management. Words from that
Wikipedia, CRM-system - application software for
organizations, designed to automate strategies for interacting with
customers (customers). CRM has disparate business tools
combined into a convenient, understandable and transparent system. Instead of Excel spreadsheets,
an abundance of messengers, a lot of documents and running around the offices of managers
salespeople get one single service. It includes programs for
customer data collection, deal management, manager monitoring, analytics and forecasting - this simplifies the routine, speeds up the adoption of the right
solutions and eliminate errors.
You might say it sounds great, but will it really help your particular
business? Let's look together at examples of how some companies
today they manage sales the old fashioned way.
1. To collect all statistics of incoming requests from customers, you need to
force several employees (or even several departments) throughout
precious hours to consolidate information from various files or accounting systems.
At the same time, the number of unanswered calls is generally impossible.
calculate.
2. Sales managers store information about their negotiations with customers
in personal notebooks or electronic tablets, which at best can
to be open to collective work, at worst, they will be
the property of this seller only.
3. When a manager needs to know how things are going with
prospective clients - managers manually prepare reports for him, often
very far from reality. And preparing these reports takes a lot
time that salespeople could devote to sales.
4. Statistics of all activities of sales managers in relation to their
customers (phone calls, meetings, e-mails or other
messengers) either no one counts at all, or they do it manually at the end
months at the request of the manager.
5. If a frequent buyer or very important customer called the company, and
place was not his personal manager, then no one else can
quickly find out and check the special conditions for a given client (or
history of his previous purchases). Yes - and it will also take a lot
time.
Maybe ten or twenty years ago it was still possible to work that way. But not
today. The Internet has incredibly speeded up our lives, and all business processes too - and
an abundance of new communication channels (social networks, instant messengers)
simultaneously increased both the opportunities for customers and the headache for
sellers. However, with the help of a CRM system, you and your company will be able to work
the way the market demands it – modern, fast, efficient.
The best assistant in this is Bitrix24.CRM. We not only know the most about
this system (since we are its developers) - we are sure that this solution will allow you to quickly and easily enable CRM and make it an integral
part of your business, the main tool of your sales department. Let's explain
in short, what are the reasons for our confidence.
Firstly, Bitrix24.CRM is part of a large popular product for
business management, which is called Bitrix24. With this decision on
At the moment, more than two million (!) Companies from different countries already use it.
If you wish, you can use only CRM - or you can get everything
the capabilities of this sought-after company management product,
teamwork, work with documents - and, of course, management
sales.
Secondly, it is an innovative and modern solution that includes
a large number of useful options for sales managers, executives
sales departments, managers and business owners.
Thirdly, you can start working with Bitrix24.CRM absolutely free of charge (and we are talking about
not about temporary access, but about working on a permanent basis). If you have a small
company, and you will use only a part of Bitrix24.CRM functions (which
there are actually a lot), then the possibilities of this solution will be enough for you
until you make the decision to scale your business further.
Fourthly, Bitrix24.CRM allows you to manage your sales department on
autopilot - just like the pilots of a modern aircraft, it is enough to raise it in
sky, and enable preset flight scenarios. Then the plane flies almost
without the participation of pilots, who only need to follow the readings of the instruments,
without touching the steering wheel.
And, what is very important with all this, it is very easy to work in Bitrix24.CRM!
Let's get started?
To begin with, it is important to say that this CRM is part of a "cloud" solution.
Bitrix24. This means that you do not need to install
your employees or the company's server any special programs or
applications that may conflict with already installed
programs or require maximum operating memory. For access to
Bitrix24.CRM your sales managers and executives will need
only access to the Internet, the CRM system itself (as well as the entire Bitrix24 product) will
work in a window of any modern browser. At the same time, Bitrix24.CRM has
of course, and a mobile application with which sellers will be able to have
access to CRM not only at your workplace, but also anywhere in the country or
world, where they find themselves on a business trip or at meetings with clients.
Therefore, to launch Bitrix24.CRM, you only need to register with
Bitrix24 product (again, you don’t have to pay for this - you can easily
you can start using the product with its free edition).
You can register at the link https://www.bitrix24.ru/register/reg.php/
Start CRM
The first page that you will see in Bitrix24.CRM is called Start.
This is where the starting point is located, after which you can start
full-fledged work in CRM (or, returning to this point, see the current
situation in your sales department). What exactly do you need to do when you first visit
at the start?
1. Connect to CRM phone numbers that are used to communicate with customers.
Why is it important? Most sales or initial contacts leading to
sale in our time, despite the development of the Internet, is still done with
telephone assistance. Now imagine that most
such phone calls… just get lost. Here are some examples:
Customers could not get through to the supplier's office or store - and bought from
competitors.
• Customers called a sales manager they knew - but he didn't
turned out to be in place, no one was puzzled by the fate of a possible deal, and
The buyer has gone to a competitor.
• Or the manager was on site, promised to call the customer back and forgot
or did it at the wrong time.
Do you think it's fantasy? Alas, situations like this happen all the time. For
to prevent them, correct them, and make the greatest possible
the number of sales calls), a telephony connection with CRM is necessary - and in
Bitrix24 is quite easy and simple to do.
At your discretion, you can:
• Rent a phone number directly in Bitrix24 - and how to do it through
Internet outgoing calls and receive incoming.
• Make integration with your PBX (cloud or office) if you already
using IP telephony.
• Bind your own phone number to CRM to work with
outgoing calls.
2. Connect the email addresses of all sales department employees (and other
email addresses that can be used to communicate with
clients).
These can be both corporate and personal email addresses, including
if for dialogues and negotiations with customers your managers for
sales use some popular mail services (mail.ru, gmail.com and
others). This can be done in a few minutes, and then a special email tracker
from CRM will be automatically fixed ovat each letter from the client (or from
manager to the client), associate them with client cards, and, if necessary,
even create leads based on it.
How necessary is it? No matter how much they say that e-mail
outdated - but it is alive and effective. Billions of letters are poisoned by email
every day, and many of these letters decide the fate of companies or individual transactions. Now imagine if your company suddenly lost the history of important
correspondence?
Most often this happens when a sales employee leaves
companies. To sort out his old corporate mail and find important
emails to some clients will take a very long time. What to say about
cases when the manager corresponded with personal e-mail? But if
the email tracker is working, then all correspondence with customers will not be lost, and a new
the manager will be able to easily understand the nuances of working with clients that previously
discussed in email.
3. You can add your existing customer base to CRM.
Returning to the previous chapter, we already said that storage and replenishment
it is most expedient to maintain such an array of data in a CRM system. Now
we assume that most of our readers do not start a business from scratch in
while reading this book. Most likely, you already have some existing
clients and contacts. It is enough to simply import them into CRM from a regular file
spreadsheet, and (if necessary) this can be done from other
CRM systems where your information may have been stored. From the moment that
information about your customers will be in Bitrix24.CRM, it will start
collect information about all actions and events that will occur
between the sales team and the customers themselves.
After phones and email are connected in your Bitrix24.CRM
mail - your sales will immediately become more transparent. In fact, from now on you
start receiving orders directly inside CRM (in the form of leads), create deals and
bring them up for sale.
Let's look at several scenarios for the work of a sales manager after
how you enabled Bitrix24.CRM:
1. Your company received an incoming call. Unfortunately, the manager
answers customer questions, was not on site - and at best, the client
was able to leave information on the answering machine. At worst, you missed the opportunity
transactions, as such a client will start calling other companies.
However, in a modern sales department, the recording of such a call with a customer question
will immediately appear in CRM. Based on the phone number, a new one will be created.
contact and potential deal (or lead) that will go to one of the managers.
He will see a new task in CRM, promptly contact the client and start negotiations. Recording a telephone conversation between a manager and a client, by the way, too
will be attached to the card of such negotiations.
2. And if you didn’t have an answering machine in such a situation, and listen to the conversation
not possible at all? A missed call won't be lost either - CRM
will create a new lead (set the task for one of the managers to contact the specified
phone number and find out what issue they called). If it suddenly turns out
that they called you by mistake - then you can delete such a request with one click
mice.
3. Customers may be emailing your company more often. On the
Based on the received letter, a new transaction will be automatically created (and if
you have not worked with this client yet, then a new lead and a new contact will appear). In this
the deal will be scheduled for the next contact with the potential client, and
it will constantly be in front of the manager's eyes in the general list
current transactions. As soon as some new event occurs on this transaction or
progress, the manager will be able to move this transaction to a new stage.
Inside Bitrix24.CRM you will be able to work with different representations of clients -
they can be presented in the form of leads, deals, or just contacts of your
clients. A little later, we will talk about the differences between leads and deals, and how
work with them, but for now - let's see what other opportunities for
receiving incoming requests and growing the client base is CRM.
We connect even more channels to CRM - and get even more customers!
1. Do you have a Facebook page? Or maybe your company has created a group
In contact with? How about a public Viber account or a Telegram channel?
Connect all these accounts to CRM!
For this, Bitrix24.CRM has a special solution (called
open lines). Now if:
- clients will publish something to your Vkontakte group,
- on a Facebook page (maybe even send a message to your business
page),
- leave a comment on Instagram to your published company
Photo, write to Viber of your company,
then you will not only be able to instantly see this appeal, but also respond to it
right inside the CRM. And customers will read the answer exactly where they left theirs
question or comment.
To do this, you do not need to create some kind of contact center or hire a special
advertising agency - they will be able to talk with potential clients themselves
sales managers. And they don't have to keep everything open.
mentioned messengers or social media pages to be in time
respond to customer requests - everything will be visible inside CRM. If customers
a lot, and one manager can’t do it in any way, then calls from Open Lines will
be distributed among different managers (in the order of the queue that you
set it yourself). If speed of response to customer questions is important to you (or
objectively there is no way to answer at some time - for example, during non-working,
holidays, or at night), then in Open Lines you can easily set up
automatic replies that customers will receive immediately. By the way,
on social media, it is greatly appreciated when a company responds, and it does so quickly.
And, of course, one of the advantages of CRM will clearly work here - when through
channels connected to Open Lines will contact your company
existing (or already known to you) client, then the question from him in the first place
will go to the manager who has already worked with this client and is responsible for it.
2. What to do if your business is not yet active on social networks, and everything that
do you have, is it your own site? You can add live chat to your site
(which can be easily installed using a special code directly from
Bitrix24), and it will also be connected to Open Lines. To all
requests that will come from your site via chat, the following will apply
the same rule - all of them will immediately appear in CRM, and managers will be able to work with
clients from the site
directly from Open Lines. And by the way, this online chat is free, and has no
no restrictions!
3. And you can add to your site not just a chat, but a complex widget from
Bitrix24. It includes:
3.1. Online chat,
3.2. Possibility to order a call back from the site
3.3. Feedback form. The visitor of the site himself chooses how he
it will be convenient to communicate with you - but any of his requests will also be in CRM
with open lines.
• If a voice conversation is more convenient for such a visitor, then he will leave
your phone number, and will receive a call from the manager, who (in his
queue) will see a new lead in CRM - ordering a phone call with a number
potential client.
• If chatting is more convenient - please! The manager will see again
the client's appeal directly to CRM, and his answer will go to the client in the chat.
• If the client is not ready to communicate right now, but decided
use the feedback form - then such information
will be immediately available to the manager (in the form of a lead, for example), and he
will be able to continue working with the client.
4. It may be that you don't even have your own website yet. No problem -
special CRM forms can provide your business with new
customers. CRM forms are such questionnaires (for example, a registration form for
event of your company or some kind of questionnaire, or a feedback form
links) that your current or potential client fills out. Looks
this profile is like a website page (where you can customize the background and fields of the questionnaire yourself).
To publish this form, you do not need to register a site, buy hosting -
you simply publish it using Bitrix24 (CRM itself will assign this profile a web
address on your Bitrix24 account), and send this link to everyone you think
necessary (or publish on social networks).
After filling out the form, the data enters the CRM (usually in the form of a lead -
however, it can also be a contact, a company, or a deal).
Forms are simple and complex, with a different set of fields, with different conditions
and settings. The main thing is that for the client it looks as simple as possible,
beautiful and attractive.
To give our own example here, one day our employees need
was to pick up corporate t-shirts. Discussing the colors and sizes of T-shirts
Chat just caused chaos. But then the CRM form from Bitrix24 came to the rescue -
a special questionnaire-questionnaire was developed, which in the form of a regular link
sent to all interested. After employees fill out the form,
data on the required quantity, colors and sizes of T-shirts immediately got into CRM
- and it was very easy to figure out who and what to order.
By the way, on such a CRM form, you can even set up payment acceptance, which
will be especially useful for small businesses or new companies that do not yet have
their online stores. And if you still have a website, then you can easily
add such a form directly to your web pages using
special codes. By the way - connect web analytics (Google Analytics or
YandexMetrica) separately for CRM forms is also enough simply.
Do not be lazy - do step by step all the tasks described above. If you have
suddenly there is no telephony that is connected to CRM - rent it
directly in Bitrix24. If your company does not yet have a business page on
Facebook or a public Viber account - get it. If you have not previously
used online chat on the site (or you don’t have a site at all yet) – hurry up,
otherwise your competitors (most of which are already online) will get ahead of you.
The main goal of all the actions that we have just described in detail is to obtain
access to a large number of new customers, many of which (due to their
belonging to younger generations and the specifics of modern
marketing) make a lot of orders or purchases only on the Internet. Start
interact with these audiences using CRM - and control this
interaction.
What happens next - after you spend a little time, and
connect all the necessary communication channels to CRM? Page Start in
Bitrix24.CRM will start showing you the current sales situation. You
you will be able to see:
a. Communication channels connected to CRM with clients. We are with you already
looked at how to connect them - but in case you haven't used all
opportunities for lead generation, then CRM will tell you what else can be done
and which channels (for example, social networks or CRM forms) are not used yet.
b. Basic reports on the work of your sales department. Here will be located
information about the overall communication load on your sales team (via
what channels comes what number of customers, and how busy it is in communication
each of your managers), current sales status (total
won deals in a given month, the number of paying customers and dynamics to
previous period or plan), the most up-to-date data (for example, for
today or last week), repeat sales situation
and deals that are currently in progress. Also there will be
the situation with Counters is displayed (quantity in time or
untimely completed cases and tasks by managers), which we will talk about a little later, and the contribution of each manager to the overall sales of the department. Of course,
reports will not appear by themselves. To get your CRM up and running
help sell, you need to do a few important things. First -
connect communication channels, the second is to start working with clients on all
these channels.
Key concepts of Bitrix24.CRM:
So, you have connected the channels, and CRM is working. Congratulations - the main stage
passed!
Imagine how many new customers your company can get
by increasing the channels from which these customers contact you. However
the value of Bitrix24.CRM is not only that your sales department can
expand your customer base - as we said, it enables your
companies to manage the sales process in a new way.
Bitrix24.CRM will start managing your sales department in the "autopilot" mode.
The system itself prompts sellers what and when they need to do in order to lead
quality and successful work with clients. Sales model
will turn into a kind of game where each of the managers will need to complete
during business hours a number of sales activities. These may be activities
leads, deals, customers – and let’s first look at how they differ:
1. Leads. As has been said more than once, a lead is not yet a client, it is only
interest expressed by a prospective client. The presence of leads in your company gives
opportunity for sellers to initiate and conclude new transactions. However, all these leads
they have to come from somewhere, right? Bitrix24 CRM has the ability to make
each lead manually (for example, a manager can process notes after
exhibition in which he participated), you can also import a whole list
leads (from a standard file from a familiar spreadsheet). But still
the most logical way would be for leads to appear automatically in CRM - and you will already
began to receive leads from all those channels that were connected to CRM.
As a result of working with a lead, it can either become a Deal (which is also not yet
is a purchase in itself, but leads to a purchase), or stay that way
lead.
In a situation where the lead is not converted (does not turn into a Deal), the manager for
sales or its manager may recognize it as of poor quality - there is
the so-called "disqualification" of the lead. This happens if:
- your phone number was called by mistake (banally mixed up
numbers),
- the client is no longer interested in your product (for some reason, this lead
obsolete),
- the letter that came to the e-mail turned out to be spam in the end (or maybe
be simply not confirmed by the mail of a possible customer).
The main task of the manager is, of course, to turn (convert) the lead into
The transaction, using all the possibilities for working with incoming requests. Exactly at
CRM actively helps sellers to do this.
List of leads in CRM
2. A deal is a negotiation process between your salespeople and your customers.
company (it is supposed to end in a sale, but of course
does not happen in every transaction). Of course, with the same client there can be
set of transactions (both over a long period of time and in a given specific
moment) - for example, your customer works with you under several contracts,
purchasing different goods or services under each agreement. As part of
Transactions Sales staff will be able to make Offers (offers or commercial offers) to customers and issue Invoices. And it may be that
some Clients from your client base have never entered into transactions with you, and
this is a good signal for sellers to pay attention to them.
Deals in CRM on a kanban board
3. Clients in CRM can be represented as Contacts and Companies. Everybody is here
is clear from the names themselves. Contacts are certain people (physical
persons), and Companies are legal entities that can be represented in CRM
many Contacts - employees of these companies. Of course, information
both about Contacts and Companies can be quite detailed - in
Bitrix24.CRM you and your managers will be able to set up a large number of
custom fields related to the specifics and scope of your business
clients.
If your company works in the field of b2b, then transactions will be concluded as
usually with companies. If your clients are private consumers (you work in
b2c), then they will be represented mainly by Contacts. In both
case, you may have a number of activities that managers
will be carried out with clients:
- call them
- receive incoming calls,
- write letters
work with clients through Open Lines (in instant messengers, chats,
in social networks)
- make commercial offers
- issue invoices to them, and so on.
Such activities may refer to the previous period of time (already
committed, including the current day), or may be scheduled (by
manager or business process in your sales department).
Contact card in Bitrix24.CRM
4. Employees of the sales department see in CRM the whole set of actions that are already
were committed by them in relation to certain clients, and which are still
to be done. If, however, some tasks or cases, the seller for different
reasons does not have time to do it on time (within the deadlines set by his manager or business processes approved by the sales department), then CRM instantly
counters will appear - numbers indicating the number of such imperfect cases according to
each of the statuses in CRM - leads, deals, clients, accounts, or cases.
Thanks to this, both the sales manager himself and his manager will
see areas where the sales force has slowed down or stalled, and
will be able to effectively manage the sales process.
5. It is the Counters that provide a new model for organizing the work of the department
sales - and manager's control of his work schedule. In Bitrix24 CRM
sellers will not need to spend a lot of time thinking about which client
now you need to talk, or what action to take next - all this to him
tell counters. As a result, a peculiar element will appear in their work.
games called "Win the Counters".
Counters of unfinished or unplanned cases in CRM
The essence of the process of competition with the Counters is that managers
on sales daily performed all the tasks assigned to them by CRM for
working with clients. The seller's mission when using Bitrix24.CRM will be
simple and understandable - all that he needs to do during each working day,
is to perform the required number of consecutive actions,
provided by the sales business process adopted in your company. Yes,
of course, it is important to do all these things with high quality (and not just “for show”), however
The experience of modern and successful sales departments clearly demonstrates that without
quality simply does not exist. The seller cannot achieve the maximum
results if he does not make the maximum possible number of correct
actions with clients. Imagine a salesperson who:
- does not call his customers on time (or never calls at all),
- ignore
accepts incoming requests (leads) from potential customers, does not look for new opportunities to close deals,
- Doesn't bill...
How much will this seller sell? Of course not.
However, in real life, such "sellers" come across quite often (especially
when a company starts building or expanding a sales force, and hires
new employees). For the two or three sales he can make
such a manager is likely to be hiding several dozen missed
opportunities that a department head or business owner never knew about
would know. If not for the CRM system, and the Counters not included in it.
And you know what's most interesting? You do not have to form with your managers
a new habit (reacting to the Counters and performing the tasks assigned to them).
The modern world has already accustomed us to such a reaction thanks to app icons.
on smartphones or social media tags, where it lights up in red
the number of missed phone calls, unread SMS received
new likes or messages. The world has changed - and the sales management process
changes accordingly.
In the case of the sales department, the lack of "red counters" for the seller should
become a habit. If the ROP sees that any of the sellers is losing
counters daily (does not cope with the current volume of leads, deals or cases),
then he can always make adjustments to the work of this employee, or the entire department,
redistributing responsibility between him and other sellers. Also for
the entire department will be very clear and obvious relationship between the results
work of the most successful sales managers and their scrupulousness and
responsibility in working with their client base. As a consequence, good
the rule of your sales department will be the end of the working day of salesmen when,
when the backlog counters are reduced to zero.
6. Of course, the head of the sales department will be able to evaluate the performance
their subordinates not only because of the absence of "burning" counters. After all, it may be
and such that the seller did a bunch of things, but sold little at the same time. To
understand the situation, Bitrix24.CRM offers enough
detailed and detailed Sales Reports that can be seen on
each element - by Leads, Deals, Companies, Contacts, Accounts. These reports
can be seen and used as each individual sales manager
(in relation to his area of ​​work), and the head of the entire department. What
the best part is that it will not take time to create such reports, they will
generated in CRM automatically for any time period or
direction related to sales.
Working with clients inside CRM
Let's now consider in what form managers and department heads
sales can see information about specific customers (or other key
entities - leads, deals) and working with them inside CRM.
1. Deal card.
This is one of the key elements of CRM. In this general card you will be able to
- instantly see the status of each individual transaction - at what stage
sales funnel it is at the moment (identification of needs
client, active negotiations, or already invoiced for payment),
- how much is the sale planned,
with whom this transaction will be concluded (company and contacts from this
companies with which work is carried out within the framework of this transaction), any
required customer information.
- and (most importantly) - this card will also show you all
a sequence of actions that has already been completed in the process
communication between the manager and the client, and what actions are still needed
commit In order for the sale to take place.
Easily? Just? Healthy? That's exactly what CRM is for - to make
the work of your sellers is both efficient and transparent. Now as a manager himself,
so his manager in a few minutes will be able to make the review up-to-date
transaction situations that require attention, and promptly
take action:
- need to call the client? There is nothing easier - just click on
phone call shortcut right in the deal card, and the conversation will start with
client.
- or maybe before that you need to listen to the previous conversation with
counterparty? Everything is also very simple - you do not need to go to
another program or another CRM page, recorded conversations or
Correspondence with the client is also available in this deal card.
- want to see the history of this transaction - whether it was
converted from incoming lead, how many offers were sent
to this client? All this information will be in front of your eyes after one
computer mouse clicks.
If your company has set up sales automation (using
special robots and Bitrix24 CRM triggers that we will tell you about
later), then when moving the transaction to the next stage of the sales funnel
(sales stage), you will immediately see which processes (for example, sending to the client
letters or sms, or the assignment of a new task to the manager) occurred
on one's own, without human intervention, and you can take them into account in further communication
with this client.
2. Kanban.
You can work with leads, deals, and accounts in kanban mode.
Kanban is a virtual board (which contains certain
sales stages). This board contains the CRM elements you want.
see at the moment (deals or leads, invoices or offers).
Kanban shows all your deals at a glance with mini deal cards
divided into columns (according to the stages of transactions). These cards are easy to drag and drop
mouse (in fact, you move the deal to the next stage in the sales funnel). In kanban mode, you don't need to study the list of deals for a long time to understand how many
and what transactions you have at the stage of signing the contract, which are only in the process
discussing the conditions with the client, and for which everything has already been sold, and only
get paid. Above each kanban column (stage) - amount: how much
will potentially bring all transactions in this status. Or already brought, if you look
to the final successful status
The goal of kanban is formulated quite clearly: to schedule and
complete all the deals on the right time in order to eventually win each
deal.
Accordingly, observing the current situation in the sales department (or at one
individual seller) to the manager (or the manager himself) will be enough
just plan actions - when and with whom of the customers you need to contact.
At the same time, of course, you need to work with clients directly from CRM -
call, contact in messengers, write letters. The result of all these
action, of course, should be sales.

3. Lists.
You can generate a list of all leads, deals, accounts,
offers, companies or contacts, and by sorting or searching
(which in Bitrix24.CRM allows you to set very precise and smart filters) choose from this list only those elements that you are interested in at the moment
moment.
ROP or the manager himself can easily find such deals, leads or companies, by
which have no follow-up actions assigned (meaning that the potential
sale may not take place due to the inaction of the sales department), or in which
things were planned, but not completed on time (overdue). As a result
it will be quite easy for the head of the sales department to influence their
subordinates, pointing them to areas of work that need attention - and
the sellers themselves will always have before their eyes an actual picture of his personal
work front. To help both managers and leaders, there will be already mentioned
us Counters - they will be displayed in each of the separate lists. AT
As a result, the manager will see how many leads, deals or accounts
he needs to work until the end of today, so as not to delay important
affairs - and also he will know that his manager will soon see this information.
This will create additional motivation for the seller to do everything on time.
Other useful features of Bitrix24.CRM
We already know how to set up and connect a CRM system, and we understand
in brief, the opportunities that sales managers receive from and from
sales managers. However, as we have already said,
Bitrix24.CRM is an innovative and modern service,
which gives its users many new opportunities to work with
by their buyers. Let's take a look at those that we haven't mentioned yet.
1. Integration with 1C and 1C tracker (enrichment of customer data).
You can enrich your CRM with customer data using a special 1C-
tracker, which is an additional source of information about
your clients. 1C-tracker works invisibly and links offline sales with
online CRM in real time. It can be easily and easily connected to
Bitrix24.CRM, and it allows you to upload the entire sales history and
clients from such popular programs as 1C: Trade Management, 1C: ERP and
all trading systems on the 1C:Enterprise platform. Also you can implement
uploading any documents and clients from 1C: Accounting and all accounting systems to
platform 1C:Enterprise (name, number, amount, responsible person, link to
document in 1C), and identify customers and search for duplicates by full name,
phone, email, counterparty ID. By the way, you can use Bitrix24
connect any number of 1C systems. It is important to understand that on the 1C side
synchronization of contacts and companies when using a 1C tracker does not occur; its task is solely to increase the amount of useful data about
clients within CRM.
In the same way, you can integrate with 1C information about accounts that
exhibited by your company. In this case, invoices are created directly within
Bitrix24.CRM, and when a certain status is reached, they are sent to 1C.
On the 1C side, the invoice can be paid or shipped, it can be
the composition of goods in the account has been changed, their cost and quantity. All this data will
automatically and sent to Bitrix24.CRM during the next synchronization. Such
changes on the CRM side will lead to changes in the corresponding orders in
1C.
2. Online store tracker.
It works exactly the same as the tracker from 1C, and starts when
your company has an online store. Bitrix24.CRM thanks to this tracker
will be filled with information about customer purchases on your company's website.
3. Face tracker.
A few years ago it was hard to even imagine - but today CRM
allows its owners to work not only with text or financial
information, but even ... to recognize the faces of the company's customers who visited
your office or store, as well as find them later on social networks. That's how it is
works:
To connect face recognition (Face tracker), you only need a web
camera with laptop or separate computer. This camera is usually
set up where it can take pictures of the faces of your visitors
(for example, when entering a store or office). Next Face Tracker automatically
recognizes faces and enters visit data into CRM. With it, you can
find out how many people visit the store, how many of them are new or how many
returned for repeat purchases. What is most interesting - such a tracker will help
find the client's Vkontakte profile, and you can contact him, invite him to
your group or make a personalized offer. Note,
that the responsibility for the conformity of the use of information about a particular
individual legal requirements of your country you bear yourself.
4. Sales automation.
Your company can work both with leads (if your business allows
generate a large flow of incoming calls), and without them (in case
your sales are built mainly on outgoing calls) - in the second
case in CRM, it makes sense to immediately create a deal. Perhaps the client's request to you requires an instant response (say, an automatic response to
email, sms or call from the manager with confirmation or clarification
order). Or the sales process should be built in such a way that
they did not have the opportunity to miss any of the potential deals,
contacting customers exactly in the time frame set by the company. All this is business
your company's processes, which should be appropriately
developed, described and configured, and Bitrix24 CRM allows you to do this with
using special tools - robots and triggers. In the next chapter,
when we talk about the stages of sales, we will show the application of such
clearer tools.
The goal of any automation is to significantly reduce human involvement in work.
processes. And Bitrix24.CRM robots and triggers, moreover, have additional
advantages - they not only free managers from tedious routine
operations and increase labor productivity, but also train them to work on
schemes adopted in the company, allow the manager to quickly identify
problem areas in these schemes and optimize them.
5. Open lines.
We have already talked about "Open lines", which allow sellers to work
inside a single window (in Bitrix24) with client messages from multiple channels
digital communications without being torn between multiple instant messengers. AT
Open lines your manager gets not only a user-friendly interface for
communication, but also the opportunity to save time and convenience, thanks to
integration with CRM. Recall that when contacting through Open Lines, contacts
new client are automatically recorded in CRM as a new lead, and the whole history
correspondence is stored in the client card. And if the question came from a client,
which is in the CRM database, then the manager who is responsible for
this client. For sales and marketing executives thanks to
Open lines receive consolidated call statistics, which
helps to analyze the level of customer satisfaction
6. We repeat that Bitrix24.CRM is not available to your salespeople and managers.
only on desktop computers or laptops - you can use and
mobile CRM. Wherever sales managers are - on the road, on a business trip
or at meetings with clients, they can always work in CRM from their
smartphones.
And finally. We talked about a simple and convenient way to launch CRM "in
cloud." However, if storage is critical to your organization
data exclusively on their own servers, then a boxed version is available Bitrix24.CRM. This software product can be purchased and installed on
servers and computers of your company.
To summarize this chapter and help you quickly and easily
launch Bitrix24.CRM, we publish a small checklist. It includes
the main points for your sales team that will help CRM earn in
full power, and your company to sell more and more efficiently.</p>
